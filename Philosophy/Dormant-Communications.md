One mystery in the consideration of the universe as having a dormant intelligence, is the scope of that intelligence. At its minimum, we know the universe's intelligence includes us as individuals, isolated or not.

Our individual intelligence can be plausibly said to connect to the planning and perceptions of others, if not solely via mechanistic communication or telepathically directly, then through some 3rd-party independent intelligence that can communicate us. People can debate this, if they haven't seen it for themselves. When enough abundant synchronicity data is witnessed and cautiously discerned as having too implausible a chance of being coincidental or accidental, then the conclusion that mechanisms of a wider intelligence network might exist, can be rationally made, as I've discerned from my own experience and am in the progress of writing up more specifically. 

The scope could vary in locality. The most-local being the individual, our own consciousness. Then next-local being those in our vicinity. Gradually, we can imagine the extension of this locality like a human neural network dormant in the wires of the universe, branching from one person to another, perhaps with telepathic or mediated communications prioritizing physical-space proximity, or perhaps entirely non-local and encompassing the wide scope of all people on Earth, or perhaps even wider and encompassing all lifeforms in the universe, or even beyond that, all particles in the universe, the physical universe itself, via stochastic modulations in a latent or non-local brain everywhere.

I've also seen evidence that whatever power exists, has some control over physics, especially more randomness-dependent outcomes, and especially in more sophisticated technologies like WiFi or AI recommender systems that heavily involve compounding-randomness but aren't so intelligent enough independently that they could possibly produce exactly the synchronistic disruption or content needed for a more general longitudinal thread in a spiritual journey...

This is hard to summarize, but the point is that there are different scopes of the possible intelligence of the universe. Is it a network that's localized to us humans on Earth, perhaps a physics bubble that our own network induces, or is it the universe itself and something that expands far beyond humanity, not in isolated bubbles, but in the vast scope of the unified cosmos?

The challenge of accepting that is, well firstly, the premise itself, if data for any sort of non-local communications and physics interventions isn't presented, but supposing I satisfied the reader's skepticism in presenting that data, there's the second challenge of contemplating how big the scope of such a God would/could be, since the universe is so big.

As DarkMatter2525 shows, our planet spatially is an infinitesimal blip, with a human-centric temporal scope that can be regarded as less than the blink of an eye.

And while that scrutiny can be answered by proposing that God's attention is prioritized towards complexity, in particular the complexity of sophisticated and rich relative consciousness experiences...

...and with a larger human-centric time scope left to come, as time progresses to justify the emptiness of the past and fill in the spatial emptiness with our expansion into the stars in the future...

It's still absurd to imagine that all of that space beyond is connected within the intelligence of a being who is predominantly focussing on us as central to that being's designs and attention, or that we might be connected to other such sub-networks of species far beyond in galaxies incomprehensible through that same being, all entangled (or not) and planning together.

With all that intelligence, it's hard to imagine [*why* unethical realities might still exist on the face of this human-centric blip of a planet, and the reasoning for the laws of physics as they are](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/Philosophy/Consciousness.md#cosmogenesis-myth).
