The idea of saying "everything is one" is counterintuitive to most people.

It’s like saying "fire is water."

Therefore, below we will more or less prove that fire is water. Fire, actually, is water.

For fun. Let’s begin.

Fire is a result of compounds breaking in such a way that their fragments bond with oxygen in the air and their rupture releases a hailstorm of bumping electrons and photons, accelerative like knives, triggering a chain reaction of more such compounds breaking up.

Those compounds are called hydrocarbons, in the case of, for example, wood. Wood is hydrocarbons. Hydrogen and carbon. Paired together in holy divorcable matrimony.

Now when you rub them together hard and long enough with enough friction, you can rupture those bonds! After all, they’re held together quite precariously by gravity and electromagnetism and all that. Squeeze ‘em hard enough and they’ll more-or-less split.

So you rub two sticks together, say, using the bow-drill method (for fire making), and you rupture those hydrocarbons into hydrogens and carbons. Now the hydrogen will bond with the oxygen (if you’re lucky), that is, in the air, and the carbon will bond with the oxygen (if you’re unlucky), and this all-around combo-reconfiguration-of-bonding<sup>TM</sup> tends to leave excess energy that shoots off like knives into your eyes (or rather specific colors of light emitted by those accelerated/reconfigured electrons) — and also potentially into other atoms and hydrocarbons. So now that emission is what you see. It’s a spark!

If enough hydrocarbons are hanging around, say you put the ember in some tinder, now those little hailstorms will trigger a chain reaction. Like knives, they’ll cut through the other hydrocarbons present, creating instability — and more shooting photons and accelerating/re-configuring electrons. 

Meanwhile, those broken off hydrogens bonded to oxygen — you know what they are? Water! Water vapor technically. Steam, if you like, with its composition of oxygen and hydrogen amidst a hailstorm of photons and electrons. That "electricity water" is fire. 

Now the carbons on the other hand can also bond with oxygen. And that creates CO2. Meanwhile, some non-combustible elements in the mix (since non-charcoal wood for example is composed combustibly of more than just hydrocarbons) create ash and, its rising form, lifted by those rising gasses and water, smoke. 

(But does that mean fire is also CO2? Depending on the composition, maybe, [though not necessarily](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-burn-something-without-producing-CO2) and [varies](https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-if-steam-contains-water-what-does-smoke-from-fire-contain-172505))

"Electriquey steam with some residue" — FIRE — in 5 words.

So fire is water? Yes, electricity water. It is possible. It’s water with some electrons creating a photoelectric rainbow of red and blue and yellow in your survival-expert-tool-wielding human eyes.

That’s fire !
