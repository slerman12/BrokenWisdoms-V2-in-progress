The idea of saying "everything is one" is counterintuitive to most people.

It’s like saying "fire is water."

Therefore, below we will more or less prove that fire is water. Fire, actually, is water.

For fun. Let’s begin.

Fire is a result of compounds breaking in such a way that their fragments bond with oxygen in the air and their rupture releases a hailstorm of accelerative electrons and photons, shooting into the air like knives, triggering a chain reaction of more such compounds breaking up.

Those compounds are called hydrocarbons, in the case of, for example, wood. Wood is hydrocarbons. Hydrogen and carbon. Paired together in holy divorcable matrimony.

Now when you rub them together hard and long enough with enough friction, you can rupture those bonds! After all, they’re held together quite precariously by gravity and electromagnetism and all of that. Squeeze ‘em hard enough and they more-or-less split.

So you rub two sticks together, say, using the [bow-drill method](https://youtu.be/_tpBCflcekU?si=XjzJAv3v1z3UOYJF) for fire making, and you rupture those hydrocarbons into hydrogens and carbons. Now the hydrogen will bond with the oxygen that is in the air (if you’re lucky), and the carbon will bond with the oxygen that is in the air  (if you’re unlucky), and this all-around combo-reconfiguration-of-bonding<sup>TM</sup> tends to leave excess energy that shoots off like knives into your eyes (or rather specific colors of light emitted by those accelerated/reconfigured electrons) — and also potentially into other atoms and hydrocarbons. So now that emission is what you see. It’s a spark!

If enough hydrocarbons are hanging around, say you put the ember in some tinder, now those little hailstorms will trigger a chain reaction. Like knives, they’ll cut through the other hydrocarbons present, creating instability — and more shooting photons and accelerating/re-configuring electrons. 

Meanwhile, those broken off hydrogens bonded to oxygen — you know what they are? Water! Water vapor technically. Steam, if you like, with its composition of oxygen and hydrogen amidst a hailstorm of photons and electrons. That "electricity water" is fire. 

Now the carbons on the other hand can also bond with oxygen. And that creates CO2. Meanwhile, some non-combustible elements in the mix (since non-charcoal wood for example is composed combustibly of more than just hydrocarbons) create the resultant ash and, its rising form, lifted by those gasses and water rising, smoke. 

(But does that mean fire is also CO2? Depending on the composition, maybe, though [very much](https://www.osha.gov/green-jobs/hydrogen/fire-explosion#:~:text=Hydrogen%20used%20in%20the%20fuel,a%20leak%20can%20be%20detected.) [not necessarily](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-burn-something-without-producing-CO2) and [varies](https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-if-steam-contains-water-what-does-smoke-from-fire-contain-172505))

"Electriquey steam with some residue" — FIRE — in 5 words.

So fire is water? Yes, reconfigured-electron (let's call it "electriquey") water (electrons accelerating the way they do within, or across, or out of, water atoms). It is possible. It’s water with some electrons creating a photoelectric rainbow of red and blue and yellow in your survival-expert-tool-wielding human eyes.

If water with a neutron added is called ["heavy water,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water) why isn't gaseous water with some reconfiguring electrons (the excess energy of which causes light to be emitted) a kind of water, with [or without](https://www.osha.gov/green-jobs/hydrogen/fire-explosion#:~:text=Hydrogen%20used%20in%20the%20fuel,a%20leak%20can%20be%20detected.) CO2 in the mix?

That’s fire! Or maybe the whole sum is fire, and "heavy water" should be renamed something else and only something else.

Disclaimer: this is meant to be educational comedy.

It still reads like tragedy.
