# <p align='center'>Early Work in Program</p>

> In progress: structure like this, and actually elaborate on the enormous work done:

## Disease Prediction
**2016 - 2020**

## Persistent Biologically-Inspired RNN Cell 
**2018**

## Long-Term Memory
**2018 - today**

## Reinforcement Learning Neural Episodic Control Algorithms, Vision Architectures, and Generalization Across Environments
**2017 - today**

> I Should probably elaborate elsewhere all the other RL algorithms I either came up with, or implemented during my PhD, "on the side" since nobody at U of R studies RL

## ChatGPT Underlying Method Innovation (Long Before Time Innovation of Underlying Method of MHDPA)
**2018**
