## Disease Prediction
**2016 - 2020**

## Persistent Biologically-Inspired RNN Cell 
**2018**

> And in between perhaps, while keeping the persistent weight initialization, so as to show what happens when those inflated GABA levels are subtracted (gradually or suddenly) and the downregulation purpose continues

> Can also test some RL environments to show temporal effects and have more than one domain

> Can even do RL and vision if I’m willing to wait for DrQV2/DQN to train on my MacBook

> Point: First medical computational neural model and long term benzos are bad / possibly have extremely systemic consequences on the brain
>
> I can also make a generative AI and show how the picture quality reduces when just some central region/layer is interfered with via a decrease in GABA and increase in Glutamate to simulate anxiety / social anxiety—“The first socially anxious deep neural network”

> Point: Begins defining neurological psychological phenomena based on neurotransmitters in computational models—for the first time
> 
> Can also show a time lapse heat map of the green/blue Glutamate/GABA spiking regions

## Long-Term Memory
**2018 - today**

> Many I came up with, but actually implemented are novel neural episodic control algorithms, from Henry to Chenliang.

## Reinforcement Learning Vision Architectures, and Generalization Across Environments
**2017 - today**

> I should probably elaborate elsewhere all of the other RL algorithms I either came up with, or invented and implemented during my PhD, "on the side" since nobody at U of R studies RL.

## ChatGPT Underlying Method Innovation (Long Before Time Innovation of Underlying Method of MHDPA)
**2018**
