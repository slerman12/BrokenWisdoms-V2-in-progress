# <p align='center'>Early Work in Program</p>

> In progress: structure like this, and actually elaborate on the enormous work done:

## Disease Prediction
**2016 - 2020**

## Persistent Biologically-Inspired RNN Cell 
**2018**

## Long-Term Memory
**2018 - today**

> Many I came up with, but actually implemented are novel neural episodic control algorithms, from Henry to Chenliang.

## Reinforcement Learning Vision Architectures, and Generalization Across Environments
**2017 - today**

> I should probably elaborate elsewhere all of the other RL algorithms I either came up with, or invented and implemented during my PhD, "on the side" since nobody at U of R studies RL.

## ChatGPT Underlying Method Innovation (Long Before Time Innovation of Underlying Method of MHDPA)
**2018**
