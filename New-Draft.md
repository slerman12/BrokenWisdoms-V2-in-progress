Dialogue of the Congress 1

War

When the Nazis came to Ukraine, they did not arrive as strangers. Long before their boots touched the soil, anti-Semitism had already taken root among the general populace of Ukraine. The Jews of Ukraine—Ashkenazi Jews, like my family—went from persecuted to tortured, including forced displacement, and mass killings, with many victims executed and buried in mass graves. My grandpa, Yury, only 13 at the time, fled with his mother, Maná, and younger sister, Rosá, escaping eastward to the relative safety of Kazakhstan, as many other Jews evacuated similarly.

Years later, when the war ended, they came back to Chernihiv. Yakob, Yury’s father, had been drafted to fight for Ukraine. He survived the war, and they were reunited—husband with wife, father with children. For years they had been apart.

A New Name

At 16, my grandpa formalized his name on the official record. He was born "Izya," a Jewish name, but in a world like his, being openly Jewish was dangerous. He adopted "Yury"—a name that could help him survive. The nickname for "Yury," which he also went by, was "Yura." During the war, his documents had been lost, and when he had to make things official, he chose "Yury" for good. His last name, though, stayed the same: "Lerman,” an old Ashkenazi Jewish surname with German origins.

Asya and Yury

After the war, my grandfather went to college in Kiev. My grandmother, Asya—a Rabinovich—was in the same city, attending a different college. They had known each other as children. She was a year older. They crossed paths again, and this time, they got married. She took his surname, "Lerman."

Not long after, the Soviet Union sent my grandfather to work as a leather technology engineer at a sheepskin factory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. So, in 1952, my grandparents left behind Kiev, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr—all the places that were tied to their lives in Ukraine. They moved to Samarkand. My grandmother, too, made a new life there, teaching German.

Samarkand

Samarkand is an old city. Maybe [one of the oldest in the world](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/history.htm#:~:text=Samarkand%20is%20one%20of%20the,goes%20back%20in%20remote%20days.). It’s been standing for thousands of years, its [architecture modest yet beautiful](https://travelcocktail.org/samarkand/). Back in ancient times, it was a key stop on the Silk Road, where trade routes from [China, India](https://www.britannica.com/place/Samarkand-Uzbekistan), [and Europe](https://www.euronews.com/travel/2015/10/19/samarkand-s-silk-road-treasures) all met. In the Soviet era, Russian became the dominant language, though Uzbek was used in official documents. Islam is the main religion there, then and now. Samarkand is a [city of intersections](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/603/)—intersections of history, culture, and commerce. Its original name, Maracanda, goes back to the 4th century BCE.

In that city, my uncle Slava was born first, then my mother, Nélya. Later, my aunt Jenya had two daughters, Lena and Irina, with Lena being the oldest. All of us—my cousins, my sister, and I—were born in Samarkand, Ashkenazi Jews all heritage sides, in an ancient, multi-ethnic city.

My mother was 33 when she had my sister, Marina. Five years later, at 38, she had me. My sister’s name was inspired by Maná, but my mother wanted something different, so she chose "Marina." My name? "Sam of Samarkand" emerged only after we immigrated to America. My real name is Siímyon. I was named after my grandmother’s sister’s late husband, Siímyon, who passed away years before I was born. But my family calls me "Syoma."

“Sam of Samarkand” (nor “Marina of Maracanda,” actually) wasn’t planned. It just happened. My name took an especially roundabout path from Siímyon, ultimately becoming “Sam of Samarkand” in America [independent of any of us](3-Opposing-Views.md#immigration).

Part 1

Severe Eczema Since a Month and a Half, Infancy

From just a month and a half old, I had severe eczema. It wasn’t something I could escape. The itchiness overwhelmed me, and my tiny infant hands couldn’t stop scratching—scratching until my skin bled, as my mom described. It was endless. I cried, scratched, and cried some more. My mom, desperate to help, put me in a baby’s shirt with mittens sewn onto the sleeves, trying to stop the scratching, trying to stop me from hurting myself.

By the time I was two or three, a family friend named Shafkad told my mom about a man—a healer living far away in a village. He wasn’t a doctor, but a kind of shaman, someone who might have a cure. My mom agreed to go. Shafkad drove us to this far-off village, which looked different from where we lived—“looking-uncivilized-village,” my mom described, in the sense that it seemed ancient, rustic.

When we arrived, a man came out, someone Shafkad knew, and he told my mom, “I’ll take him to the healer. No, you stay here.”

My mom wanted to come along, but the man wouldn’t allow it. "No. You not allowed." Maybe because she was a woman, and this was a Muslim village. 

She hesitated, but Shafkad reassured her. “No, no. They’re good people. They heal.”

And so, reluctantly, she stayed behind. I went.

After about twenty minutes, they brought me back. The man who had taken me returned with the healer. He was a short, middle-aged man—maybe in his 40s or 50s—who looked Uzbek or perhaps Tajik.

The healer looked at my mom and said, “Sorry. I couldn’t. I don’t know how to. I couldn’t help your son. I don’t know how to fix it.” That was it. He didn’t accept payment. “I couldn’t heal him. I can’t.”

Before we left, the healer spoke again. “Are you going to America? Maybe they can heal him there. They have better doctors.”

My mom didn’t know how he knew about our plans to immigrate, if Shafkad had told him or how.

And so we left. I didn’t leave healed, but the shaman was genuine in reinforcing hope for us regarding the unknown abilities of the doctors in America. The shaman may have also spoken of demons, attempting to rid me of them—perhaps successfully—though he could do nothing for the eczema.

My mom recounted this memory [in an interview recently](link to interview).
