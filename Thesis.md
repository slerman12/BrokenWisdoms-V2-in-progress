2020 - 2023

> So what, just gonna ignore **[UnifiedML](6-Opposing-Views.md#unifiedml), [XRD project](6-Opposing-Views.md#niaz-abdolrahim), [2 publications](6-Opposing-Views.md#chenliang-xu), [grants](6-Opposing-Views.md#literally-did-the-grants), [evolutionary learning algorithms](6-Opposing-Views.md#chenliang---early-days), [Visio-Relational Perceiver](6-Opposing-Views.md#chenliang---early-days), [real-time RL robotics](6-Opposing-Views.md#real-time-rl-robotics), [a general-purpose parallelized memory and sampler](6-Opposing-Views.md#sampling-without-replacement-in-rl-description), [entire GATO/JEPA type framework](6-Opposing-Views.md#unifiedml) before either were proposed**?

Fully implemented on my GitHubs and elaborated on as much as humanly possible in a microsecond timespan to the committee, by the video meeting, many slides, and long emails. I'm not qualified. They want certain formalities that look like the scientific method, without actually noticing that more of the actual substance was delivered them than from any other student. There are no RL experts in U of R. There weren't deep learning experts there. They doubted me my whole PhD, as stated even by the best faculty member, Henry Kautz, on email record, having discouraged me from studying MHDPA in 2018. Until the 2020s, most faculty at the U of R still thought deep learning was a fad. The new ones are superficially interested in structures that look like the scientific method, but dismiss the ones that sound too big and too good to be true, because the structures they use don't account for exceptional work. All of them arrived late. None of them are qualified to mentor or evaluate me.

Specifically, by "arrived late," I don't just mean as faculty members; I mean there isn't a single person at the U of R who knows as much about deep learning as I do, or who's been studying it in its modern form as long as I have, and I was kind to them and trying to explain, in every way humanly possible, better and more passionately/faithfully/caringly than anybody would've.

# $\mathfrak{\mathrm{E}pilogue}$

## Conclusion

- Proposition 3 is the policy of accountability that the PhD student handbook requires the faculty to satisfy.
- Disproof 7 formally disproves the claim of Proposition 3, and proves that the faculty are currently violating the policy of the PhD student handbook.

<p align='center'>ð–¥¸</p>

- An Alderman of the ruling judges ultimately invoked the policy of the PhD student handbook as his justification for the latest in a series of atrocities committed against me by this institution.
- The Alderman initially tried to invoke other reasons for the atrocity, but the reality didn't support him.
- The Alderman is the only ruling judge charged by the University of Rochester to me as the representative of the policies behind those atrocities.

"Who is Sam?" the Congress asks.

"Heâ€™s a PhD flunkee," the Alderman decides, and slams his gavel against the ivory surface of his desk.

The mallet's head breaks with the **wisdoms** in its alder, and the <!--cracked-->**broken** wood sprouts with roots<!--,--> and branches<!--, and moss-->.

In a thunder, the Alder Tree, awoken<!-- from the mallet-->, says, $\mathfrak{\color{green}\text{\color{green}`` Y}o{\color{green}u}'r{\color{green}e} \ \text{\color{green}w}r{\color{green}o}n{\color{green}g.\text{''}}}$
