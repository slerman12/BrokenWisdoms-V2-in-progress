## Eczema at Infancy

<!--
From as early as a month and a half old, I suffered from severe eczema. The itching took hold of me like an uncontrollable force, and I scratched until my skin bled. It was a constant cycle: scratching, crying, scratching, crying. My mother had to wrap cloths around my hands, a shirt with the hands covered, just so I wouldn’t tear at myself and bleed.

When I was two, almost three, a family friend named Shafkad told my mother of a man, a healer, somewhere in a distant village. This healer, a shaman, wasn’t your typical doctor, but he had a reputation—maybe he could cure me. Shafkad offered to take us to this faraway place, to see what the healer might do. So, Shafkad drove, until we arrived in a village that looked untouched by civilization. There, a man—someone Shafkad knew—took me aside. He said, "I’ll take him to the healer. You stay here."

My mother insisted on going with us. She wanted to be there, to see for herself. But the man was firm: "No. You stay here."

Perhaps it was because she was a woman, and the village was Muslim, but they wouldn't let her come. My mother was anxious, but Shafkad reassured her. "Don’t worry. Everything will be fine. They’re good people. They’ll heal him."

So, they waited. Twenty minutes passed, maybe more, before we returned—two men carried me. One was the man who had taken me, and the other was the healer, a short man, somewhere in his forties or fifties, with the weathered features of someone born to the land. Uzbek, or maybe Tajik.

The healer didn’t speak much. He looked me over and then turned to my mother. "I’m sorry," he said. "I couldn’t heal him. I’ve driven out all the demons from him, but I don’t know how to heal this. I don’t know how to fix what’s wrong."

He didn’t ask for money. There was no charge. Just the words, "I couldn’t do it. I can’t."

Before we left, the shaman said something strange. Somehow, he knew we were planning to immigrate. My mother was sure Shafkad hadn’t told him, but the healer knew, somehow. "Are you going to America?" he asked. "Maybe there, they have better doctors. Maybe they can heal him there."

I had severe eczema from a month and a half "age" old. I got this itchiness, and scratched myself, scratched myself to blood. I itched the whole body, cried, scratched myself, scratched, cried. My mom had to put cloths on my hands, babies' cloths to cover my hands, so I'd not scratch to blood.<!--My mom got shirts with the sleeves stitched closed to keep me from tearing my skin.-->

When I was 2, about 3, a family friend, Shafkad, said there is some man in some village, some far away village, who can treat people, a healer, a shaman, not a traditional healer, and he said he can take us there to see what this person can say or do; maybe he can heal me from eczema. He drove us there, and we went to some village, not-civilized-looking village. There, a man (a different man, not the healer) came, somebody Shafkad knew, and this man said, "I'll take him to that healer. No you stay here." My mom wanted to go. "No. You not allowed." Maybe because she was a woman and it was Muslim, they didn't let her go there. She was worried. Shafkad assured that everything is alright either way. He knows these people. "No no. They good people. They heal."

They were waiting and after some time, maybe 20 minutes, they brought me back, two people, the guy who took me and another, the shaman, healer, a short man, Uzbek or Tajik maybe, native-Uzbek looking, middle age, maybe 40 something, 50. He said he couldn't heal me, that he got rid of all demons from me and couldn't heal it. "Sorry. I couldn't. I don't know how to. I couldn't help your son. I don't know how to fix it." 

He didn't take money. He just said, "I couldn't heal him. I can't."

The shaman somehow knew that we were immigrating. My mom didn't know how. She thought maybe Shafkad told him. Somehow he knew. He said, "Are you going to America? Maybe they can heal him. They have better doctors there."

<!--The shaman somehow knew that we were immigrating. Maybe Shafkad told him — somehow he knew. My mom didn't know how.-->

## Induced Hair Loss <!--(*fellowship with man*)-->

In the summer immediately at the head of my first year as a PhD student, my university-hospital doctor Lisa Beck prescribed a medication called Dupilumab. It's a biologic agent that one injects into their stomach that laser-targets a specific antibody associated with eczema. My eczema was severe and debilitating. Some time into taking the medication—I think maybe 8 months—my university-provided health insurance Aetna cut me off from the drug without warning. I wasn't notified by Aetna or my doctor, or the university-owned hospital, but by the university-owned intermediary deliverer, who was responsible for delivering the drug on a recurring basis to my doorstep, since it can't—or at least at the time couldn't—be provided for pick-up at a pharmacy. They called me and told me they couldn't reach my doctor, but for some reason Aetna had decided to no longer cover the prescription. 

`Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab about 8 months into my dependency without warning.`

`The deliverer couldn't reach my doctor.`

I remember walking up and down Mt. Hope Avenue with my phone in a panic calling my doctor trying to reach her, and the university deliverer telling me they were trying to do the same and couldn't reach her either. After a while, my hair started falling out rapidly. I have no genetic predisposition to baldness, from any side of my family. The abnormally rapid hair loss was obviously due to the dependency and cessation. 

Though it fell out quickly, I didn't notice at first. The shower drains were filled with hair every day, and I thought it was maybe my housemate's girlfriend's. I didn't get to see my doctor until later in the summer (when her office had scheduled it: August 14), a long time after, when I think much of the side and top of my head were bald. She diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. To be clear, she diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation<!-- of Dupilumab-->. She and her nurse took pictures and stored them in the university-hospital computers. 

`I wasn't given the appointment with my doctor until months after.`
<!--`I wasn't given an appointment with my doctor until at least a month, maybe two months or more, after the missed injection.`-->

`The cessation initially caused Alopecia Areata.`

Eventually, she sorted out things with the university-provided health insurance, but by then it was too late. Most of my hair had fallen out.

`The drug was delivered after I lost my hair.`

<!--## Premonitions-->

We finally got a delivery of the drug. I wasn't sure whether it'd be safer at that point to re-instigate the dependency/addiction or avoid the drug at all costs.

Here's a personal story, since I was fixated with Taoism at the time:

To help me weigh the difficult decision—and it was difficult because that medication was extremely potent and didn't even help my eczema much, and I believed my hair would grow back—I asked the I Ching. Here I'll describe the hexagrams I got because I find it interesting that one of the predictions came true, and this might be medically useful since it corresponded thrice with my hair growing back (all three resurgences after the Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning after every piece of hair from my body had fallen out).

`The Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis.`

The I Ching "answered" it didn't matter which of the two paths I chose ("The town may be changed, / But the well cannot be changed. / It neither decreases nor increases." - "The Well", unchanging). (Maybe an interesting observation: that the English "well" is phonetically similar to "wellness," as well). It also had previously "answered" my hair would grow back of its own accord, which it did, temporarily. I still remember: "Difficulty at the beginning" (as Richard Wilhelm described: "The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth—hence the meaning, 'Difficulty at the beginning'.") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) "Fellowship with man" (e.g., baldness). That answer about whether my hair will grow back came true with the steak-only diet (steak is "manly" and so that again ties to the hexagram symbolism of "Fellowship with man"), almost like a suggestion for how my hair can "sprout" out of the earth, my head, like blades of grass, again... which it did, temporarily but covering my entire head except for an unnoticeable tiny spot at the top of my scalp.

Then all the hair fell out again. Again, total baldness. No eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, my pubic hair fully grew back—temporarily.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, a few eyelashes grew back for the first time. 

That can't be a coincidence, so I leave this story here both for medical utility and for the understanding that [I now look like Gollum](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10211230008185126&set=a.1273659620707) because of medical malpractice.

`I now look like Gollum`, and `other Gollum-esque symptoms` (see ["Fall, 2018 semester, and the Dead Marshes"](#fall-2018-semester-and-the-dead-marshes) and ["Nails"](#nails)).
<!--`I now look like Gollum`, and, though I didn't specify them yet here, there were `other "Gollum-esque" symptoms` as well (see ["Fall, 2018 semester, and the Dead Marshes"](#fall-2018-semester-and-the-dead-marshes) and ["Nails"](#nails)).-->

> [!WARNING]
> By the way, the scariest nightmare I ever had, over and over that whole night, was the day I injected Dupilumab the first time. I remember my housemate at the time in the other room and I wanted to wake him. That's how scared I was. The nightmare was of a tall skinny slenderman, who kept approaching to "assault" me. Every time I closed my eyes and fell asleep, he'd reappear. Again and again, for that whole night. I never had a nightmare like that before. It was vivid.

## Foreboding Electric Razor 

My grandpa gave me his electric razor when I was in high school. It was the first razor I ever had and the only one I'd ever used through high school and college.

In that 2017 summer, before I started the Dupilumab, my mom and I celebrated my graduation from college ("uni," in European-speak) by going to Europe, and my razor broke in the luggage.

<!-- <br><i><b>Note:</b> I finished making this diagram just as Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" started playing on my Spotify, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was "Psycho Killer" which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then "Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar)." Not bad. Any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Sarah to Elliott Smith for the first time with the song "Between the Bars" (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars [Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them]) while we were in the hospital (between the bars of confinement). Since she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there, I think she'll appreciate these observations in this caption when I show her, though it would unfortunately be a non-sequitor to make any claims to their nature or significance. Some of these however are just linguistic.</i> -->

### Uncanny beard premonition

My grandpa actually gave me his razor, an electric razor. It was the first razor I ever had, that I used to shave in high school and all through college. I was right-handed; I'm sure my grandpa used his left hand; I'm sure Charles was startled when I started coming into the office at the Center for Health and Technology, in the late summer of 2017, with the early traces of a beard.

It was the [first time I grew out my beard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144) and I did so out of an intuition, just before Aetna had cut me off from Dupilumab.

## House on May St.

My hair fell out while I lived in my *house on May St.*, a miraculous situation where the landlord—who I'd never met previously—rented me a 4-bedroom nice antique house near both the university and the park in Rochester where the Lilac Festival is held, to myself, for $600/month, starting Fall, 2017—well, technically one bedroom from that house, but I had the whole place to myself pretty much for the next year, and even furnished at least one other bed from another room since, inexplicably and literally miraculously, the landlord didn't believe he could find anyone on his own without my help to rent out to, and he wanted grad students. 

It was beautiful, and even had a porch and balcony, big kitchen, a freezer for big-game hunting (this detail becomes funny later), basement, dishwasher, and laundry machine. Of some of the PhD students who visited me, some needed housing, and later the landlord and I showed them around the rooms (maybe not even prior to me furnishing any of the other bedrooms, which the landlord didn't mind that I'd done, seeing as my best friend and I also beautifully furnished that whole house together during one of my best friend's visits early when I moved in, really beautifully, and that increased the value of the house more, in addition to the sofa and tables and furnishings and beds and desks that the landlord provided—did I mention the word "miraculous" yet?), and one of them even mentioned to the landlord at the end having the funds to pay the full year's rent already—I don't remember why they ended up not moving in, but that was also clearly miraculous. I did end up renting out the attic (which was like a studio apartment, well, a giant room) to one of my friends from high school for the landlord after maybe 4 months of having the place to myself, and even then it was pretty much entirely my house, though he also set up a DJ station for himself in the basement since he threw raves (not in the house), and had his girlfriend over, but he kept quiet, and he wasn't a grad student, but the landlord had a strong belief in my judgement again, miraculously so.

Pets weren't allowed, but that's okay, because there was a [semi-adopted stray who regularly came to visit me outside and sat with me on (or near) my porch named "Batman" (according to his collar)](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/KXoyjpZeM6tsKRrE/), and I loved him very much if the video doesn't make that clear.

Months before I moved out, I became the admin/moderator of the [university Facebook housing page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1112684565415024/) by chance, because the actual admin posted he was looking for a student to moderate the page for him, and I responded that I could do it. My landlord didn't know (and probably still doesn't) that I'm the effective-admin/moderator of that page. Also, since then, I've messaged the manager/admin of that group multiple times to give the moderation to someone else or moderate it himself and he hasn't replied, and doesn't appear to use Facebook, so hereforth I'm permitting myself to call myself the admin. I'm glad to moderate, but not super good at keeping up to date with it. So, after there was no chance left of getting to keep the place to just myself and friend longer, I ended up finding University of Rochester grad students to fill all 4 bedrooms of the house, and all 4 bedrooms of the neighboring house, also belonging to the landlord—I think "semi-detached home" is what it's called—and, thanks to the ad I ended up posting ([here it is](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe5ceff-3b06-4582-97fb-c13c30d00564)), I redirected inquiries to my landlord's email and my landlord's email flooded with other PhD students looking to fill that house, including one of the ones who'd originally wanted and planned to who I'd notified (he moved into the attached one, closer to what was at the time an abandoned building and Highland Park). I ended up adding my landlord to that page, where, technically I'm not supposed to allow landlords, only students. Sorry for this phrasing, but the landlord's house is now "never lacking" in interested grad students looking to rent from him. In fact, lucky for him, the neighboring commercial building is now [a herbal apothecary](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/19/little-apothecary-becomes-little-herbary-south-ave-rochester-ny/2365775001/), since it was abandoned when I lived there (due to, if I recall correctly, a murder, though I didn't know that moving in).

I also grew out a full beard <!--(except a really small patch probably from a lifetime of topical eczema creams, as my pediatrician told me was happening in high school or college)--> and full mustache mostly in those first months I lived in that May St. house, based on an independent Paleo-based intuition/principle. [Here's a picture with my family at that house from my 22nd birthday](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144), not too long after I started to grow it out. My best friend [visited me](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/c7m83bHR5v1mP4p4/) on December 15th, 2017 at that house and encouraged me to shave it (just before we went to a rave that day, the other friend's who would later move in with me, coincidentally), some months before Aetna cut me off from the prescription to Dupilumab, but it was the first time I ever grew out my facial hair.

I was working really hard in that house, developing my long-term memory research ideas and implementing the code for it there, meditating every day while practicing strict dietary (Paleo and organic) disciplines, practicing many asceticisms including not watching movies and TV shows, no unnatural lights after 8 PM except candlelight and always going to bed by 10 or 11, reading philosophy books and academic works for entertainment, cooking all of my food fresh, cold rather than hot showers (e.g., Wim Hof method), while working on campus taking full semesters of grad-level classes, and at the University of Rochester's Medical Center, building neural models to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease, and that house is where I started to get my idea for how stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics could explain a mechanism for "God" or some intelligent power in nature, hypothetically.

I was sleeping in one of the second bedrooms, when, on a rare occasion, my housemate friend and his girlfriend woke me climbing up the stairs. Somehow I had a sudden realization, near around 3 AM or whatever time it was in that night, that the universe's particles might be random, and therefore can be shifted by slight divergences by an intelligence—like the biological kind (or modeled by the artificial kind)—in such a way that still respects the known laws of physics and yet permits the possibility of an intelligent nature, that can modulate how those particles are sampled with respect to the sampling distributions.

In that house, somewhat before, and thereafter (continuing for years, mostly without pause), I was practicing many disciplines, including meditation, Paleo diet, and ascetic disciplines. I learned the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique from an instructor, while living there. The instructor I learned from through the TM program was trained directly by the creator/translator of the technique, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru/yogi the Beatles infamously learned their meditation practice from. I experienced the subtle sinking/melting of my state of consciousness, including visceral physiological sensations, perhaps what some people have observed/called as "Kundalini," that I hadn't heard of yet and came to from Googling my physical sensations, that were a movement in my chest, back of neck/maybe esophagus/throat region, or into my third eye/lobe region, visceral and physical, and that I had full control of the motion of, in each axis direction of movement. The meditation brought my consciousness to a sublime state and alleviated my social anxiety.

<!--
Later, after some time without that "Kundalini" sensation, I described how I theorized TM might work to another skeptical PhD student, my friend Mohsen, who'd actually visited me in that house and met "Batman" once, but on a hiking/camping/kayaking/hotel trip much later in the Adirondacks and Niagra Falls, that it had something to do with the distribution of processing systems in the brain. For example: attenuating to a mantra, reduces other area attention activity such that unconscious thinking processes can be allocated. However, while still in the house on May St., I had a different philosophy, involving my physical body, as well as associative and long-term memory— but I can't remember what it was. I have notes in a small red journal (not a reference to Jung's "Red Book," but I was reading Jung at the time) [here](). To do: find journal and link photos
-->

<!--
The beard had a really small bald patch similar to places on my body where my skin was very smooth that my pediatrician (who I was still seeing in my Freshman year of college) diagnosed while I was a Freshman in college as probably due to the use of prescribed topical creams for eczema on those parts of my body. My chin is one of those areas where I got eczema and had applied those creams through high school and college. My head, eyelashes, armpits, and pubic area weren't.
-->

It was in that house when Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab and my hair started falling out.
<!--
After living in the House on May St., and after my hair had begun falling out, I moved in with my mom to our apartment, where I came up with my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) (the method underlying ChatGPT) in 2018, and it was in the middle of wrapping up that, after all my hair had fallen out, that I was hospitalized (no prior history). It was actually in the first hospitalization, at RGH, where I ran the successful experiments for that paper, since the hospital staff had allowed my mom to bring in my laptop. It was in the second hospital, at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital (see ["The unsampled world at Clover St."](#the-unsampled-world-at-clover-st)), where I described relational reasoning to my brother-in-law and showed that paper to my fellow inpatient, Sarah (real name used with permission).

## Psychiatry at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital

I'm $5\text{'}5\text{'' } 110\text{lb}$.

I had a prescription for benzos before, Xanax, but for eczema and social anxiety, $\text{1/4}$ to $\text{1/2}$ of a milligram to be taken daily or as needed. I took them sometimes during my junior and senior years of college at the University of Rochester, as needed, usually for social anxiety, usually spaced out by more than two weeks, during the time when I took them at all, and they gave me small hangovers/dazes when the effect wore off. Knowing they were in a similar class of drugs to alcohol (see [below](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action)), I took them conservatively.

I had to stay in the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital for a month and take $48\text{x}$ that dosage, of the comparatively strong-per-duration-per-milligram Ativan, reduced later to $10\text{x}$ that dosage, over the course of $3$ times per day, every day, for that month and more than $5$ months after due to doctor-induced dependence and doctor-dependent tapering scheduling, the details of what was being treated still un-inquired about, incommunicable, and unbeknownst to them, solely derived from the medical record from RGH (see ["My trauma"](#my-trauma) for elaboration on this). Think about that. $\text{1/4}$ to $\text{1/2}$ of a milligram, once every two weeks at most (and usually much more rarely), had side effects. $48\text{x}$ $-$ $10\text{x}$ that dosage, but every day.

Accounting for dosage *and* rate, that's a minimum $336\text{x}$ $-$ $70\text{x}$ &nbsp; to &nbsp; $672\text{x}$ $-$ $140\text{x}$ increase.

Just prior to this, the I Ching had answered to me about the reason for the less-than-ideal consciousness that rules humanity: "Difficulty at the beginning" $\rightarrow$ "Increase." My interpretation: Struggle among people from infancy or childhood, or at the outset of a crisis ("Difficulty at the beginning") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) Perpetual acceleration of interventions, or, more specifically, dependence of an individual, collective, or collective standards and systems on more mechanisms of intervention, rather than pause, substitution, remembrance, reconsideration, or decrease of all of what preceded ("Increase"). Yes, all the I Ching answers specified in this book were/are real. The crisis at the "beginning" can also be interpreted as, for example, one's hair no longer sprouting from one's head, or further yet back to simply eczema. <!--Maybe comment out this last sentence-->

For the first three or so weeks, I was really, really drunk/high. Then the fog rolled in. The chemical waterboarding was taking effect.

[This link opens to a video with a different medical philosophy. It's worth clicking on, no matter one's skepticism.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-)

I was also on antipsychotics, but these next chapters will not be about antipsychotics (see ["Geriatric unit hospitalization"](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization) for some elaboration on antipsychotics), since the benzos were added on top of them, making their evaluative efficacy compared to the damage from benzos hard to disentangle. The rest of this Part will be about the experience that was most-plausibly caused by the benzos.

Let's begin a simplified explanation of the brain's neuron. Neurons are cells that are connected to one another by dendrites and axons that pass chemical messengers from one neuron to downstream neurons. The two most common chemical messengers in the brain are the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory means they cause the next neuron to also release their neurotransmitters ("fire"). Inhibitory means they lower the voltage activity of the next neuron such that the next neuron is subdued. GABA is the mechanism of action of alcohol. People think alcohol is "disinhibitory," that it "disinhibits" them, but the reality is alcohol is actually inhibitory. It confuses GABA receptors, causing an inhibition of that neuron and all the neurons in your brain. It's a system-wide drug that indiscriminately simulates GABA throughout every part of your brain, from the Occipital lobe, where your eyes see (in the back of your head), to the frontal lobe, where your brain thinks it thinks.

The brain has evolved some countermeasure thanks <!--at least--> to fermented fruit existing in nature.
<!--
Benzos are GABA agonists, like alcohol. That means they simulate GABA or enhance GABA receptor function. In response, the brain downregulates GABA production and receptor sensitivity universally across the brain, universally, from the parts that are understood to the parts that almost entirely aren't, including some of the most important regions of intelligence whose healthy metric level of functioning is extremely hard to measure behaviorally, clinically, and longitudinally across variants of factors, and necessary for quality living, e.g., the hippocampus responsible for long-term memory. Alcohol does this too, but humans have provably evolved natural mechanisms of recovering from small doses of alcohol thanks to fermented fruit existing in nature. Benzos seem like a Godsend, a Panacea, especially since you're less likely to feel a headache the next day from them for the same effect, but the [evidence isn't strong enough to support they're better on the brain in the long-term than alcohol](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/drugs-linked-to-brain-damage-30-years-ago-2127504.html). From what I've gathered, benzos are worse. Since it's somewhat relevant, [here](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) is a video I made on evolutionary algorithms in deep learning.

Nobody understands this mechanism. To understand this mechanism, you'd have to solve all of neurology and artificial intelligence, and psychiatrists definitely haven't. Benzos are a floodbath of GABA, and your brain responds to those GABA bursts by "downregulation," even long, long after cessation.

Despite the similarities to alcohol, benzos are synthetic, achieve much the same effect without a person being able to notice the same short-term consequences like immediate hangover, and are often prescribed to be taken daily for long periods of time. [Studies haven't shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/) that the long-term consequences are preferable to those of alcohol, many [quite the opposite](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8629021/), and <!--(at least)--> my experience<!--, as well as that of [many others](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/), taking only as prescribed, were--> was so severe that I <!--would--> strongly bet worse.

## My Trauma

My trauma revolves around three psychiatrists.

**PSYCHIATRIST 1:** "I will taper you off from the benzos. You will be tapered off *before* discharge."

> `Psychiatrist 1 reassured, I'll be weaned off from the benzos,` *before* `discharge from the hospital.`

**PSYCHIATRIST 2:** "The tapering schedule is too fast (even though we decide when to discharge you) and the outpatient doctor, the psychiatrist after the hospitalization, will taper you off. You will be tapered off *right after* discharge."

> `Psychiatrist 2 came in on the momentum of her previous post (to replace Psychiatrist 1), and changed the schedule, standing next to the first psychiatrist, who hesitantly, self-doubtingly told her that he'd planned to taper me off before the discharge since I was worried.`
>
> `Maybe she didn't trust that I would continue with therapy if the physiological addiction didn't send me there by threat.`
>
> `But she reassured, I'll be weaned off from the benzos,` *right after* `discharge from the hospital.`

**PSYCHIATRIST 3:** "Benzos can be safely taken for years. You need to take them. I want to increase the dose. Did you pull your hair out yourself?"

> `I told Psychiatrist 3 my symptoms. He was cold, authoritative, and disbelieving. He only believed the benzos were needed. He said that benzos could be safely taken for years, and didn't counterargue my points against that that I made to him. At no point for the next 5 months would he specify a tapering schedule, and I was arguing and begging him to taper.`
> 
> `He asked about my hair loss, whether I had pulled the hair out myself. He wouldn't believe me the first couple times I answered. Not only didn't I pull it out myself, but the medical system did, the one that was now making me answer repeatedly whether I did.`
> 
> `I kept begging him to taper in later sessions as well, and he said if I was having all those negative symptoms, that we should increase the dose. That would've started a perpetual race against the brain's downregulation mechanisms.` *He wanted to increase the dose.*

I argued against the benzos with all 3 psychiatrists.

With Psychiatrists 1 and 2, I only took them due to the threat of court order.

With Psychiatrist 3, I only took them due to (a) his recommendation and instruction, (b) the guilt about the earlier hospitalization, and me questioning even the most basic logic and instincts I perceived, while noticeably, adding extremely to the self-doubt, my brain was running slower than others due to the drug, thinking I really was sick in the way these doctors understood, (c) the mental impairment induced by the drug, and (d) insecurity about tapering off by myself, amid the severe physiological dependence.

Furthermore, they were treating a misdiagnosis, "catatonia"—that's what the benzos were prescribed for—that I never went through. I couldn't explain that to them because (a) I didn't know the definition of "catatonia" yet, and (b) the trauma of what I went through was too recent to summarize. 

> `In RGH, they were prescribed due to that false diagnosis of "catatonia." The University of Rochester's Strong Hospital wanted to prevent a recurrence—that is, "preventatively"—threatened a court order if I didn't take them, and 3 psychiatrists changed, contradicted, and perpetually extended each other's scheduling for the taper.`

Additionally, maybe the most unbelievable part: they didn't ask about what I went through. They treated "catatonia" and "bipolar mania" as the indubitably exhaustive description. "Catatonia," which is what the benzos were meant to treat, was fully a misdiagnosis. The other diagnosis from the medical record was "bipolar mania," for which I was being given Risperdals, a strong antipsychotic, in addition to benzos. None of the previous diagnoses from the first hospitalization, none of what RGH wrote, were investigated or asked about in any extent by the University of Rochester's psychiatrists.

Due to their practices, I was on benzos for >6 months. 

Symptoms from taking the benzos as prescribed included: 
- [Severe cognitive impairment](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/)
- [Constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/)

- Mouth dryness, and tooth calcification, as diagnosed as being due to benzos by dental hygienist
  - Chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out after the benzos that she diagnosed as decalcification
- Severe generalized anxiety, previously undiagnosed
- [Severe social anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/)

- Severe physiological dependence, which benzos cause more so, at least neurologically, than Dupilumab, which also causes/caused a physiological dependence
- PTSD from all of these symptoms and the recurrence of a malpractice-induced perhaps-permanent trauma
- [Scientifically-backed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/) fear of permanent damage
- [More than a year of all of this, no sleep, non-stop persisting neurochemical torture](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cksl7u/health_disaster_brain_damage_alopecia_universalis/)

Almost nearing Fall, 2019, I tried to kill myself. The helium tank connected to tubing was found by my mom, and my family hid it from me.

The experience of losing my hair has cost me relationships and worsened my social anxiety, and the benzo-brain damage and torture leaves me with PTSD.

## My Grandma's Hair, Nails, and Dementia

### Childhood

### $\Huge &#8220;$
*Moscow was bombed every day, sometimes multiple times a day. 500 airplanes bombed the city in one day. Not only bombs, but also a lot of lighters were thrown from the airplanes. The alarm of the air raid required everyone to step down to the underground [bomb shelters], and I went there too. But if the air raid came at the time of our work shift, we, all working at the armory [defense factory], children*<!-- [children working at the defense factory]-->*, climbed on the roof. Our responsibility was to take the hot lighters and throw them off the roof, to prevent a fire.*
### $\Huge &#8221;$
&ensp;&ensp; - Translated to English by my mom from an interview with my grandma that my mom did for MCC, in October, 2000. Brackets denote my edits.

My grandma was 13 and my great aunt Tsilia was 18. Their dad was fighting in the war front. Their mother had died when my grandma was 5 and her sister was 10, from typhus. Their step mother was sick with tuberculosis; and their little younger step-brother Yura, 10 years younger than my grandma, was too young to help with throwing the fire bombs.

<!--
My grandma was about 24 when she and my grandpa (different Yura) arrived to Samarkand.  She was a German language teacher, before my uncle was born. She didn't know German, but she knew Yiddish, so she accepted the job, since Yiddish is close to German. Later, she was a teacher of Russian language and Russian literature, separate fields. Later, she was an academic principal of a school and continued teaching.
-->

### Nails

My grandma was about 24 when she and my grandpa (different Yura) had to immigrate to Samarkand.  She was a German language teacher, before my uncle was born. She didn't know German, but she knew Yiddish, so she accepted the job, since Yiddish is close to German. Later, she was a teacher of two separate fields, Russian language, and literature, and later, an academic principal of a school and continued teaching.

At old age, she had long grey hair, down to even her waist or hips. She curled it up behind her head, in a very elegant/pretty bun, with hair pins.

I inherited my mom's hair, who inherited my grandma's hair.

<!--My grandma had long grey hair, down to almost her waist or hips. She curled it up behind her head with hair pins, like in a bun but prettier.-->

In addition to losing all of my hair — head, eyebrows, and eyelashes — due to the Dupilumab cessation, my eczema temporarily spiked and I lost my fingernails in functionality in later 2018, also unambiguously due to the Dupilumab cessation. They regrew, healthily functional enough, after being purple, and bendy like putty, for a really long time, maybe into 2019. 

`Additional side effects included temporarily worsened eczema, and fingernails turning purple and bending like putty.`

My grandma actually told me I had her nails. I even remember where. But I also have her eyes, and my mom's eyes, brown eyes. But, randomly, my grandma mentioned it, about my nails, when we were sitting in the backseat of the car. My mom and grandpa were in the front seats. My mom was probably driving us to the Jewish Community Center, to swim in the community pool there. My grandma saw my fingers and just mentioned that I had her nails, unusual.

Without hair, without eyebrows and eyelashes, with even my grandma's fingernails purple and bending out of my nails, and isolation and heavy workloads, just what I needed was a >6 months course of benzos to get all the symptoms of early-onset dementia.

### The Probable Cause of My Grandma's Dementia

[Benzos contribute to the likelihood of dementia in elderly people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325366/).

My grandma was prescribed a cocktail of neuroactive drugs before she had dementia. Seroquel, Lyrica, Xanax, and the brochure goes on. She didn't have any of the conditions those medications are primarily supposed to treat (Seroquel is an antipsychotic, Lyrica is an antiepileptic, Xanax is a benzo), and every time she developed a new symptom from one, they prescribed yet another. She developed dementia when I was still in high school. She lived with dementia from then to my Junior year of college, the same year my grandpa died, 2016.

<!--
That semester I was dating somebody who told me something about my nails. My grandma actually told me I had her nails. I even remember where. But I also have her eyes, and my mom's eyes, brown eyes. But, randomly, my grandma mentioned it, about my nails, when we were sitting in the backseat of the car. My mom and grandpa were in the front seats. My mom was probably driving us to the Jewish Community Center, to swim in the pool there. My grandma saw my fingers and just mentioned that I had her nails, unusual, but something I'm proud of.

In 2016, the semester she died, someone I was dating made an even more unusual remark about my nails.

## How My Grandpa Died

### Lyubimey V'nuk

When I was a kid, I listed off my favorite family members once, in my order of favorite, in front of all of them who were in our apartment living room, either standing or eating at the table. Maybe I was 5 or so. I remember they all looked big and I was standing. Grandpa was sitting in his bigger chair at the table and I started, "Babula" ("Grandma"), "Máma," "Marina," ... and then after all the others who I listed, I listed my grandpa. I still remember that. He wasn't offended, and I love and loved my grandpa a lot. In maybe 16 years, I would be standing by his bedside in the hospital, after a heart surgery he had, when he'd tell me: "Ti moy lyubimey v'nuk" ("You are my favorite grandson."). He has 4 grandkids: Irina, Lena, Marina, and me. I'm his only grandson... 

I remember sitting by my grandpa's bedside, alternating days and nights. My mom or I were needed there at all times. He was almost 88, and the languages he spoke were Russian, Ukrainian, and Yiddish, and he was legally blind. He and I couldn't watch the same TV when he lived with us, because he neither spoke English nor could see, but sometimes when I visited my grandma's and his apartment unit immediately across from ours (after they'd moved, since originally we lived together), we watched Russian Television Network together, and they actually got some Cable channels from the government program, as well. In my apartment, we only had ABC, FOX, NBC, CBS, and PBS. Then we also got an additional channel, the CW. With high school and college, I had, uh, resourcefulness, and Netflix. During those days and nights at his bedside in the hospital, in the hospital recliner chair next to him, I watched a lot of Doctor Who on Netflix on my laptop, a show about an alien with two hearts called The Doctor that resurrects after each death, the previous generation surviving in the next, and the next, and the next. It's the [longest running science fiction show in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who#:~:text=The%20series%20has%20been%20listed,ratings%2C%20DVD%20and%20book%20sales.), a show that originally started with an old grandpa.

### Surgery

My grandpa survived two heart attacks previously, one in Uzbekistan and one in America. 

Here is how he ended up in the hospital: Sometime in the month of November, in 2015, he was having trouble breathing, my mom took him to his primary care doctor, she diagnosed him with congestive heart failure, she prescribed pills, then about a month and a week of taking pills later, he was still having trouble breathing, my mom took him to the hospital, they took a blood analysis, and apparently he'd had a third heart attack, that occurred about a week before. So my grandpa's heart doctor came into the hospital, recommended a stent be put in my grandpa's heart's main artery, via a surgery, and that the surgery would use an angiogram. The angiogram would require a dye that is bad for the kidneys. The primary care physician wanted to discharge my grandpa and send him for rehabilitation already, without the surgery; the heart doctor told my mom "without the surgery, his heart would only get worse" and that "he'd only have heart attacks and eventually die," so my mom chose to listen to the heart doctor, they did the angiogram, they tried to do the surgery, but the main artery was completely blocked, the surgeon wasn't able to do the surgery so put stents into the little arteries that were narrow but weren't the cause of the congestive heart failure, and right after the impromptu-alternative-surgery, which required an angiogram, which used the dye that was bad for the kidneys, my grandpa's kidneys got so bad he couldn't walk at all anymore; he couldn't stand up on his feet.

I was visiting him on alternating nights before and after the surgery. Then, after the New Year 2016, the hospital didn't know what do with him, discharged him, and sent him to the Jewish home for rehabilitation, for physical therapy to help with his worsened kidneys. They also scheduled a follow-up appointment with his heart doctor in that heart doctor's private office, separate from both the hospital and Jewish home, in a different location from either, for January 21, 2016.

### Transit

My grandpa was a self-reliant man, but the transit two weeks later on January 21, 2016 from the Jewish home to that heart doctor's office was extreme. My mom was there, and it was a big ordeal just to help him stand amid the kidney problems that were causing him difficulty moving. How big a toll that transfer of locations took: they resorted to using an elevating machine that lifted him, an almost 88 year old man, up from his bed. 

"Why was he discharged from the hospital?" the heart doctor had asked at that appointment in his office. "In this condition, he should be in the hospital."

My grandpa's heart failed that night, after the grueling trial to make the heart doctor appointment, in all likelihood because of that grueling trial. His official death was the night of that heart doctor appointment, January 22, 2016.

My grandpa was not one to miss a grueling transit. On July 3, 1941, my grandpa, his mom Maná, and his younger sister Rosá evacuated Ukraine. They went place to place by train, lived in different places, worked at farms. Once, they took the train from Rostov, and the train stopped. My grandpa was young, maybe 14. He thought, "I'll go to the market nearby and buy something." He bought a little bit of bread and kielbasa. When he came back, he discovered his train already left. So he asked people. They said, "There's a place where those trains stop. You can go there and take another train; they go the same direction, so maybe you can catch up with your previous train," and he saw, one train had already started moving, one train there on that platform, already in motion, and he decided he could jump, so he jumped. He was holding on, but he was gonna fall, and he thought he was gonna fall under the train. But there was someone who picked him up, quickly pulled him on (elevated him onto this big mechanical machine), someone on that train, someone who was there who quickly pulled him up. He ended up making it to their previous train's destination before his mom and sister, waiting for them, as theirs which had more stops in their transit's journey, arrived after him.

This time, my grandpa arrived a little before my grandma, despite being a little younger, in the same year, just a few months before.

In Uzbekistan, it was custom for doctors to visit patients. Physicians always came to patient homes, or wherever the patient was, standardly, in Uzbek healthcare. But America and Uzbekistan had something in common, regarding their healthcare systems: cardiologists (heart doctors) specifically, didn't visit patient homes. In our neighboring apartment units, my grandpa was having trouble breathing, but could still walk, and had survived three heart attacks previous to his death. Perhaps the heart doctor was right, and he'd keep having heart attacks and eventually die, but eventually was the night of their appointment, after a heroic ordeal to get to that office that my grandpa, with heavy strain, survived, and made it back in time to the Jewish home for his final destination, earlier than had he never gotten off the first train for some bread and kielbasa.

## When My Grandma Died

### Food

My grandma, Asya Lerman (Hebrew/American: "Esya") always cooked, healthy and really well, but she had type-2 diabetes at old age.
I remember, for herself, she had to use artificial sweeteners because she couldn't eat pure sugar.
She also made these delicious Russian cookies for us called "Korshike," that I loved, that she also put into these different mold shapes, hearts and stars and fish and circles. I liked to eat the raw dough sometimes, but she didn't let me eat it in large quantities because of eggs and the risk of salmonella.

I had healthier food than the average American as a kid — plov, cabbage stews, potato stews, salads, katleti, tefteli, borscht, pelmeni — despite my family's poverty, but I still had eczema, allergies, and asthma through my whole childhood.

My grandma taught my mom dancing when they were younger, in Uzbekistan. Seeing my grandpa bedridden in the hospital, even before the surgery, it was obvious to me that he was losing strength, just from the sedentary confinement to bed, that the doctors put him in, in a corner of a concrete-surrounded hospital, with no natural light, nature, or fresh air. He would've benefited from some motion, out of bed and walking, outdoors, with nature, with fresh air. At least once a day, each day, without any grueling transits to reach such an environment.

I really think had the hospital recommended my grandpa an organic steak/salmon-only diet, and nothing more, they possibly could've saved his main artery from being blocked, without a surgery. Then no stents would be put into his healthier narrow arteries, no damaged kidneys, no grueling transit to heart doctor. Just physical therapy and rehabilitation. And maybe many more years, living beyond my grandma.

### Numerical Timings

She shortly outlived my grandpa, and died the same year as him **three days before** his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016.

I suppose she'd've had to forestall her death as well, then, seeing she died just a few months after he died, in the same year, as if on purpose, joining him exactly 3 days before his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016, where 13 both symbolizes a death kind of day and has the number 3, as in 3 days before, and 2016 has the number 16, the upcoming day of my grandpa's birthday.

She couldn't have died on a more perfect day, except if my grandpa lived a many, many years longer.

My grandpa also gets two claims to rhythmic numerical timing: (1) He entered the hospital on December 22, 2015, spent two weeks in the hospital, two weeks in the Jewish home, and then died exactly a month after, on January 22, 2016, (2) He, Yury Lerman, was born "Izya"; but during the war, as documents were lost and "Izya" was a Jewish name amid an extremely anti-semitic Ukraine, he called himself "Yura," or the full name, "Yury," and that became his new name with the new documents when he was about 16, the same age (16 again) as my name was officially changed to "Sam" actually, by amazing ancestral-but-unintended rhyme.

Now for some stretchier synchronicities:

As for my grandma, the number 13 also includes a number that "is less than 3," e.g. a heart <3, which a modern readership might be able to visually appreciate universally across languages, having been a teacher of varied languages, including Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish, and German (and she also learned English after we immigrated), in her life.

Besides 16, another synchronistic number is 7. My grandma was born March 25, 1927. My mom was born July 17, 1957 (07/17/57). And <!--my cousin--> Irina, who takes the most from my grandma besides me, was born November 17, one day and 6 years apart from my birthday. And my grandpa was 87 when he died.

And 2016 has the number 16, that, besides being the upcoming day of my grandpa's birthday, was the beginning of a larger-scope revolution in politics, and reformed perceptions of the healthcare system, with the 2016 ascent of another, similar Jewish old-grandpa type character and role model to me, Bernie Sanders, who has some similarities to my grandpa. 

My grandma's numerical timing of when she died is a proof symbol in my opinion on the perception and characterized message of my grandpa's death involving the heart doctor seeming synchronistic: that the healthcare system needs reform. And the ascent of Bernie, whose name slantly rhymes with "Yury," synchronized in tune, means a lot to me about the need for reforming healthcare systems, not just in governance, but inside the systems themselves, from elderly care, to prescription habits, to the dietary and environment principles. 

### Massages

I had severe eczema, and my grandma, mom, and grandpa when I was a kid helped by giving the best massages. My grandma's were the best of the best of theirs.

## Ascent of a Jewish old grandpa

I’d heard about Bernie Sanders from reading about him on Facebook, and I met some supporters who’d even heard of him before his 2015 - 2016 presidential run. I was getting his campaign emails, it was still early in his campaign before the 2016 Democratic primaries, and I told my mom about him, that I wanted to donate from the link in a campaign email from him. She was worried, thinking it might be spam.

That wasn’t implausible, that a politician who her son is describing as actually caring about policies, with principles, who calls himself a "socialist" and is Jewish, and is making serious headway as a contender for the office of president in America, is some kind of trick.

It didn’t take long before she could see he was a serious and sincere "politician," and the word "politician" has to go in quotes, because Bernie’s "politics" are about actual governing.

My mom donated to him, too.

"Bernie Sanders" is a household name today, so much so that some people might roll their eyes, call me a "Bernie bro." But unlike the "Bernie bros" across the Democratic party leadership who have taken on his positions and rhetoric, without giving credit to the fact that they actively stood opposed to those very positions and rhetoric when Bernie was still bringing those views into the mainstream all his life, I’m a [Bernie "supporter,"](https://github.com/slerman12/Governance/blob/main/Does-Nature-Endorse%3F.md) not bro.

Those ideas, like Medicare For All, a $15 minimum wage, ending the corruption of Wall St., acknowledging the huge gap between "the top 1% and the 99%," have become popular talking points thanks to his campaigns (though the non-Bernie talking heads often leave out public funding of elections and overturning Citizens United), which made a bigger difference in American political knowledge and culture than any of the Democrats who campaigned against him, including the one who became president.

<!--How to transition into this? Well, let’s start with my experience in the elderly-care unit.-->

## Geriatric Unit Hospitalization

Speaking of the elderly...

> To do: Paragraphs, sub-chapters

> [!WARNING]
> 
> In December, 2020, I had another hospitalization, my last hospitalization, the geriatric unit (elderly facility) one.
>
> I was leading another one of my advisor's students on a long-term memory paper called [Eclectic-Mem](https://github.com/slerman12/Eclectic-Mem) for my advisor, that I still had an extremely intense amount of work to do on in order to make the ICML deadline. My family members visited. I was again following some kind of yogic-trance, but this time, much less spiritually guided. I knew that the yogic state I'd been in before was real, and I didn't want to disobey the new flow that had taken over. I was acting strange in front of the visiting family members, and my mom called the ambulance. My behavior was strange enough that the responders decided to take me to the hospital, and as they were doing so, I broke from the obedience to that pseudo-flow state and started screaming to my mom that there was an ICML paper deadline that I had to submit to. This was still 2020, months after my first paper. The responders took me away, so far with no concrete reason to do so, but only my mom's call and the superficial strangeness of my behavior.
>
> In particular, what caused my mom to call the ambulance was I was doing stretches on the couch without talking to my relatives when they were talking to me. Then the strange behavior with responders, who I did talk to, and whose questions I answered normally, was that I was slightly reluctant to let them take my vitals — yes. And I quickly did let them take my vitals. They just caught that I had some reluctance and found that suspicious. So they dragged me to the ambulance, and I was screaming to my mom about the paper deadline as they did so. The ambulance drove me to the hospital, where first, they brought me to a lobby.

> In the lobby, the nurse pulled me behind a curtain and made me change clothes, and I didn't want to (was slightly reluctant), but she told me I had to. Then she sat me in a wheelchair. A nurse pushed it forward, it ran over my big toe, and I screamed out specifically that my toe was run over. The nurse kept rolling me off, as she and the other nurses all ignored my screaming, in what, surprisingly, didn't break my toe.

> Each day I was told I'd be transferred that day or the next day. I had to sleep there in a chair for a week. The dungeon-like area was full, in every square foot of the open areas, with other patients, who slept on mattresses or also in chairs. The clinicians seemed to forget about me and still had no particular reason for the imprisonment.

> Finally, they specified a reason for why they were holding me. Apparently my mom said I wasn't eating enough, which she later denied saying. Ironically, I was eating a lot. Usually 5 organic steaks and a salmon every day, about half of my income. I was lectured pretty heavily by a fat woman specialist about how carbs are a necessary part of a healthy diet. That was Winter, 2020/2021, perhaps just before diets like the keto diet gained scientific support, or maybe already after. During that hospitalization, chunks of my hair fell out. The rapid timing was extremely coincidental, so maybe the onset of the hair loss was independent to the hospitalization, or maybe a synchronicity, but most likely exacerbated, because I thought I was in Hell.

> The anxiety was so extreme that my eczema became itchy just from that, if not the food. I ate all of their garbage food. I made special requests, but the diet they provided wasn't more than what you'd expect from hospital food, and always came with an abundance of chocolate Ensures, enough to probably buy a steak honestly.

> Of all the hospitalizations (excluding aftermath), the most traumatic was the geriatric unit one. And not because they ran over my toe with the wheelchair that I was in and ignored my pained screams, nor the enclosed-dungeon area where they made me sleep in a chair for a week, eat stuff I was allergic too, take benzos temporarily again, and share living space amid lots of commotion and tons of people, but because of the geriatric unit they subsequently transferred me to. Old people. People I thought were sketchy. One friend, black guy I shared pudding crackers with at the window later, after, when I managed to get out of my room from the trauma of thinking I was in Hell. Other than that, coldness, Hell-setting, and, while I was still confined to my bed due to the intensity of the earlier dungeon area where they kept saying they'd transfer me to a room later that day and didn't for another week, I was under the delusion in that geriatric unit environment that I was literally in Hell, the beam of red light shining into my window from the neighboring hospital roof, being stuck in a floor with no nature, old lady in the room next door screaming "Oh Christia! Oh Christia!" every day, only plastic and children's colors and an artificial picture painting across from my door. And I had a whole bed and bathroom to myself, but still. The nurses and staff were fine, but the environment was bad.
>
> That was the geriatric unit hospitalization, psychiatric wards were full, ran over my toe, they kept me in an open-room with other patients, and then after like a week of me sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to a geriatric unit, with me unable to leave my bed through New Year's because I thought I was in Hell, once they situated me in that geriatric unit room, no visitors. They had no knowledge of that Hell thinking, nor was that my state of thinking coming into the hospitalization. 
>
> In the hospitalization between the benzo-trauma inititiating one and this one, "Hospitalization 3," I was able to spit out the benzos they were giving me. I wasn't risking the tongue trick from before to spit out the benzos, here, Hospitalization 4 (and last). I wasn't in that kind of flow state. But later, when they gave me a Covid mask, in the geriatric unit, which I don't recall if they did while in the open area with other patients, I got to spit the benzos out into that.
>
> I think they did a Covid test before transferring me, though I don't recall one. I'm just inferring, since it was a geriatric unit (a unit for the elderly). Yes, I recall mention of a Covid test. I don't know if it was before or after the dungeon-area.

> To summarize:
> - `My big toe was painfully run over by the nurse, and ignored`, no attention paid, disregarded screaming.
> - `I had to sleep in a chair in a shared open area filled with other patients for a week` with only scary clinical authorities who came around occasionally to interrogate me, drugs handed to me, and `with food mostly only that I was allergic to`, while in an increasingly sensitive state, and `being told I'd be transferred to a room later that day or the next day.`
> - I was transferred to a geriatric unit, with almost nobody my age, and an environment that lacked any nature, with only synthetic plastics, no genuine warmth, and an abundance of chocolate Ensures.

> Some crazy-person advice: Clinicians should stop using the expression "I'm gonna take your vitals," because when a patient thinks they're in Hell, that is a terrifying thing to hear. Then they have no choice but to let those clinicians strap them or inject them or whatever, and their mind possibly is tuned to a ritual level of thinking where symbolism has extreme sacred meaning. The symbolism of "vitals" being "taken," in the context of vampyrism or losing a loved one, isn't good. Just a suggestion.

> While drugged with benzos in the enclosed-dungeon area, my brain went from that strange pseudo-schizotypal paranoia I began in to a full blown "I'm literally condemned here forever and this is literally a robot dimension or Hell" state.

> Since Winter, 2020/2021, I have not had another serious or psychiatric hospitalization. There was one hospitalization half a year later, in which I was there for half a day, but they neither held me there nor believed there was any psychiatric issue. The geriatric unit hospitalization was traumatizing, but that's not the reason why I successfully avoided future imprisonments. My ability to live with those schizophrenic states (trances, including less trustworthy ones), consciously and drug-free, increased to the point that they aren't schizophrenic states, but unambiguous connections to a deeper wisdom (or, some "intelligence" of some kind, depending what social influences are most authoritatively in my life). [Humans and other cultures have been integrating that wisdom long before hospitals existed.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-) Though this geriatric unit hospitalization isn't a good example, I was and have become pretty good at navigating those states of consciousness and integrating them in the moment, usefully, creatively, and sometimes powerfully.

> Nor Hollywood, even. At the end of [A Beautiful Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)), the nobel prizewinner with schizophrenia, John Nash, is depicted as achieving stability by taking his medications. The real John Nash objected to them, and lived pretty much his entire life unmedicated, starting from long before he came up with the work that led to his winning the Nobel Prize. While the movie's depiction is somehow extremely romantic to medical systems, it's inaccurate to the true history of how he surmounted his diagnoses. ["In Sylvia Nasar's book with the same title, on which the film is based, it is clearly stated that Nash stopped taking medication in 1970 because of the way it blunted his intellect. The change was apparently made because the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, whose mother was a prominent psychologist, was worried that the film might persuade people to stop taking their medication."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics) Yes, the film based on a true story might persuade people wrongly. So better fabricate it. ["in a scene [around the time of the character's Nobel Prize nomination in 1994], Russell Crowe explicitly credits his recovery [...] to newer medication. The truth is that Nash stopped taking any medication in 1970. The line is a fabrication, and a conscious one."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

> ["Nash described sanity as a form of conformity, and one about which he maintained a degree of ambivalence. 'So, at the present time, I seem to be thinking rationally in the style that is characteristic of scientists,' he wrote. 'However, this is not entirely a matter of joy, as if someone returned from physical disability to good physical health. One aspect of this is that rationality of thought imposes a limit on a person's concept of his relation to the cosmos.' There can be no doubt that to talk in such terms requires both honesty and tremendous courage. The question is whether we have the courage to hear him."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

To do: Make a diagram specifically for geriatric unit hospitalization (University of Rochester's Strong Hospital).

Chronology: Lobby wheelchair toe -> open-area chair sleeping with processed eczema-causing food, more coerced benzos, and interrogative military clinicians -> geriatric unit -> them arguing carbs were a necessary part of a healthy diet and stating that the reason for holding me in that hospitalization was that I wasn't eating enough (even as I ate all of their garbage food).

## Second Induced Hair Loss

Full head hair regrowth in Alopecia Universalis, especially with comorbid eczema, is extremely medically rare. 

By the time of the Psyche hospitalization, I was on a mostly-steak-only diet since at least as far back as June, 2020 (with wild-caught salmon as well), which I remember since at that time I was working on my Psyche-CAM paper, but probably back to May or April.

See [here](4-Faith.md#mikhaila-peterson) for where I'd initially heard of this diet from. Specifically, the diet I heard of and read about was "beef-only."

The first month of that diet included many unwanted but temporary and [expected](https://carnivoresnax.com/blogs/articles/side-effects-of-carnivore-diet?srsltid=AfmBOooxOb6gWQrauNAH3Eqc9rI2AqqSU61Tp1dTbRSRpzqtyBlfsMFP) physical symptoms.

<!--Previous to the final version of my diet, beginning initially from Paleo, I transitioned to (organic) beef-only. The organic-beef-only phase was about a month and caused watery bowel movement symptoms and decreased stool frequency, as were expected from what I'd heard and read about the diet. By the end of that month, I think my energy and mood, and probably cognition, had massively improved. Gradually, the majority of my beef came from organic, grass fed, grass-finished steak and not long after, perhaps in that month as well, I added daily salmon in the morning.-->
Beginning from Paleo, I switched to organic beef-only, which is what I read and heard about, and, within that month or after a month, I added occasional salmon.

My diet converged to about one wild-caught salmon each morning and about 5 organic, grass fed, grass-finished steaks per day, and organic black pepper and salt, and water. I used lots of salt and fried the fat from the steak. 

I experienced big improvements to my cognition, energy, and mood. <!--In particular, I recall my writing, not academic but poems, visual creative writing, and texts to people, had improved that summer to beyond even where they were before the benzo brain damage. Most of my income was going towards this experimental recovering, meant to improve my head from the benzo-induced impairments — and, unexpectedly, my hair started to grow back while on that diet within the next couple months. I was also practicing other disciplines, including meditating, calisthenics, and abstaining from porn, all of which I continued from previous to this diet.-->

In the hospitalization after the Sarah-one, Hospitalization 3, [Mobi](#Mobi) remarked on my hair when we saw a Duplumab commercial and I mentioned that the drug made me lose my hair ("oh that's why"). 

I was walking around bravely sometimes, past all the nurses and patients, from my room to the phone without hat. 

<!-- - The causal mechanisms of all of these independent, non-local phenomena don't erase the divergent statistical odds of their synchronous timings. -->
  
- Hospitalization 3 had given me a lot of junk food and I was eating lots of sweets after, as well, still on the dietary momentum from that hospitalization, even chocolate-chip cookies and cakes and things like that, somewhat addictively. But then I resumed strict discipline and a steak-primarily diet maybe a month or so after. I think steak/salmon-only. Amazingly, my eczema didn't return during the hospitalization or after, but that break in my disciplined diet, largely induced by the hospital, could've been what caused or heavily contributed to the sudden hair loss again, that happened in Hospitalization 4, the geriatric unit. 
- I even fasted before my hair started growing back, so strict discipline wasn't what caused it to fall out in December. But fasting is unlikely to have been what caused it to grow back. It was a prolonged fast, about 7 days. I did 3 prolonged fasts in my life. Only that one corresponded (later) with hair regrowth. During that period, otherwise, before and during the onset of my hair regrowth, I was only doing steak/salmon-only diet strictly.
<!--
Maybe: - Warning: If one is not physically active, the steak diet and keto diets in general might not be good for eczema, from experience. They give energy, and if that energy isn’t activated into physical movement, I find it turns into tearing at the skin. 
-->

[In the next hospitalization, in the geriatric unit](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), there was a guy my age. I sat with him every day towards my last days there at the window. He and I talked. We were talking about deep things. I told him about my self-consciousness about my hair, since chunks of it were falling out again in that geriatric unit, and he said he couldn't even tell anything was bald. I think he even had some balding that he showed me, and said that he loses hair all the time, that my hair looked good, and not to worry. In other words, my hair had fully grown back, enough to pass the eye test of a guy sitting right next to me. *My head hair had fully grown back.*

But, in case the detail was missed ("since chunks of it were falling out again in that [geriatric unit](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization)"), it was there that it turned out to be falling out again, and proceeded to partially for months after, to the point that now it looks worse than it would've had it never grown back. I have to shave it from my head, something I don't like doing, to maintain the bald upper bound of my current mutilated appearance, that otherwise now grows in in patches, with more bald skin than hairy skin. That is exponentially worse than the first time they caused my hair to fall out.

`My hair was induced to fall out again after I regrew it through hard and expensive discipline, resulting in an Alopecia Areata that looks exponentially worse than the previous Alopecia Universalis.`

Despite my self-consciousness, for the most part, I didn't wear a hat during that hospitalization, so many people saw my head. My mom said, "I didn't think you need it" over the phone when I got mad at her for not dropping it off when she dropped off one steak in a plastic Tupperware. I was lectured about not eating enough carbs (which steak doesn't have) by one of the hospital staff. They required I eat carbs for me to be discharged, since they said my diet, was why I was being held, and specifically that my mom told them I wasn't eating enough (which she denied). <!--This requirement was already after the week in the enclosed-dungeon area.-->

My hair was falling into my hands again in the [geriatric unit in December, 2020](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), most likely because of the practices in that coerced hospital stay or the temporary dietary consequences of the previous coerced hospital stay.

That sudden hair regrowth was, miraculously, more than 2 years after the Dupilumab cessation that induced the Alopecia Universalis, and covered my head.
