## Eczema at Infancy

<!--
From as early as a month and a half old, I suffered from severe eczema. The itching took hold of me like an uncontrollable force, and I scratched until my skin bled. It was a constant cycle: scratching, crying, scratching, crying. My mother had to wrap cloths around my hands, a shirt with the hands covered, just so I wouldn’t tear at myself and bleed.

When I was two, almost three, a family friend named Shafkad told my mother of a man, a healer, somewhere in a distant village. This healer, a shaman, wasn’t your typical doctor, but he had a reputation—maybe he could cure me. Shafkad offered to take us to this faraway place, to see what the healer might do. So, Shafkad drove, until we arrived in a village that looked untouched by civilization. There, a man—someone Shafkad knew—took me aside. He said, "I’ll take him to the healer. You stay here."

My mother insisted on going with us. She wanted to be there, to see for herself. But the man was firm: "No. You stay here."

Perhaps it was because she was a woman, and the village was Muslim, but they wouldn't let her come. My mother was anxious, but Shafkad reassured her. "Don’t worry. Everything will be fine. They’re good people. They’ll heal him."

So, they waited. Twenty minutes passed, maybe more, before we returned—two men carried me. One was the man who had taken me, and the other was the healer, a short man, somewhere in his forties or fifties, with the weathered features of someone born to the land. Uzbek, or maybe Tajik.

The healer didn’t speak much. He looked me over and then turned to my mother. "I’m sorry," he said. "I couldn’t heal him. I’ve driven out all the demons from him, but I don’t know how to heal this. I don’t know how to fix what’s wrong."

He didn’t ask for money. There was no charge. Just the words, "I couldn’t do it. I can’t."

Before we left, the shaman said something strange. Somehow, he knew we were planning to immigrate. My mother was sure Shafkad hadn’t told him, but the healer knew, somehow. "Are you going to America?" he asked. "Maybe there, they have better doctors. Maybe they can heal him there."

I had severe eczema from a month and a half "age" old. I got this itchiness, and scratched myself, scratched myself to blood. I itched the whole body, cried, scratched myself, scratched, cried. My mom had to put cloths on my hands, babies' cloths to cover my hands, so I'd not scratch to blood.<!--My mom got shirts with the sleeves stitched closed to keep me from tearing my skin.-->

When I was 2, about 3, a family friend, Shafkad, said there is some man in some village, some far away village, who can treat people, a healer, a shaman, not a traditional healer, and he said he can take us there to see what this person can say or do; maybe he can heal me from eczema. He drove us there, and we went to some village, not-civilized-looking village. There, a man (a different man, not the healer) came, somebody Shafkad knew, and this man said, "I'll take him to that healer. No you stay here." My mom wanted to go. "No. You not allowed." Maybe because she was a woman and it was Muslim, they didn't let her go there. She was worried. Shafkad assured that everything is alright either way. He knows these people. "No no. They good people. They heal."

They were waiting and after some time, maybe 20 minutes, they brought me back, two people, the guy who took me and another, the shaman, healer, a short man, Uzbek or Tajik maybe, native-Uzbek looking, middle age, maybe 40 something, 50. He said he couldn't heal me, that he got rid of all demons from me and couldn't heal it. "Sorry. I couldn't. I don't know how to. I couldn't help your son. I don't know how to fix it." 

He didn't take money. He just said, "I couldn't heal him. I can't."

The shaman somehow knew that we were immigrating. My mom didn't know how. She thought maybe Shafkad told him. Somehow he knew. He said, "Are you going to America? Maybe they can heal him. They have better doctors there."

<!--The shaman somehow knew that we were immigrating. Maybe Shafkad told him — somehow he knew. My mom didn't know how.-->

## Induced Hair Loss <!--(*fellowship with man*)-->

In the summer immediately at the head of my first year as a PhD student, my university-hospital doctor Lisa Beck prescribed a medication called Dupilumab. It's a biologic agent that one injects into their stomach that laser-targets a specific antibody associated with eczema. My eczema was severe and debilitating. Some time into taking the medication—I think maybe 8 months—my university-provided health insurance Aetna cut me off from the drug without warning. I wasn't notified by Aetna or my doctor, or the university-owned hospital, but by the university-owned intermediary deliverer, who was responsible for delivering the drug on a recurring basis to my doorstep, since it can't—or at least at the time couldn't—be provided for pick-up at a pharmacy. They called me and told me they couldn't reach my doctor, but for some reason Aetna had decided to no longer cover the prescription. 

`Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab about 8 months into my dependency without warning.`

`The deliverer couldn't reach my doctor.`

I remember walking up and down Mt. Hope Avenue with my phone in a panic calling my doctor trying to reach her, and the university deliverer telling me they were trying to do the same and couldn't reach her either. After a while, my hair started falling out rapidly. I have no genetic predisposition to baldness, from any side of my family. The abnormally rapid hair loss was obviously due to the dependency and cessation. 

Though it fell out quickly, I didn't notice at first. The shower drains were filled with hair every day, and I thought it was maybe my housemate's girlfriend's. I didn't get to see my doctor until later in the summer (when her office had scheduled it: August 14), a long time after, when I think much of the side and top of my head were bald. She diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. To be clear, she diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation<!-- of Dupilumab-->. She and her nurse took pictures and stored them in the university-hospital computers. 

`I wasn't given the appointment with my doctor until months after.`
<!--`I wasn't given an appointment with my doctor until at least a month, maybe two months or more, after the missed injection.`-->

`The cessation initially caused Alopecia Areata.`

Eventually, she sorted out things with the university-provided health insurance, but by then it was too late. Most of my hair had fallen out.

`The drug was delivered after I lost my hair.`

<!--## Premonitions-->

We finally got a delivery of the drug. I wasn't sure whether it'd be safer at that point to re-instigate the dependency/addiction or avoid the drug at all costs.

Here's a personal story, since I was fixated with Taoism at the time:

To help me weigh the difficult decision—and it was difficult because that medication was extremely potent and didn't even help my eczema much, and I believed my hair would grow back—I asked the I Ching. Here I'll describe the hexagrams I got because I find it interesting that one of the predictions came true, and this might be medically useful since it corresponded thrice with my hair growing back (all three resurgences after the Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning after every piece of hair from my body had fallen out).

`The Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis.`

The I Ching "answered" it didn't matter which of the two paths I chose ("The town may be changed, / But the well cannot be changed. / It neither decreases nor increases." - "The Well", unchanging). (Maybe an interesting observation: that the English "well" is phonetically similar to "wellness," as well). It also had previously "answered" my hair would grow back of its own accord, which it did, temporarily. I still remember: "Difficulty at the beginning" (as Richard Wilhelm described: "The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth—hence the meaning, 'Difficulty at the beginning'.") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) "Fellowship with man" (e.g., baldness). That answer about whether my hair will grow back came true with the steak-only diet (steak is "manly" and so that again ties to the hexagram symbolism of "Fellowship with man"), almost like a suggestion for how my hair can "sprout" out of the earth, my head, like blades of grass, again... which it did, temporarily but covering my entire head except for an unnoticeable tiny spot at the top of my scalp.

Then all the hair fell out again. Again, total baldness. No eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, my pubic hair fully grew back—temporarily.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, a few eyelashes grew back for the first time. 

That can't be a coincidence, so I leave this story here both for medical utility and for the understanding that [I now look like Gollum](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10211230008185126&set=a.1273659620707) because of medical malpractice.

`I now look like Gollum`, and `other Gollum-esque symptoms` (see ["Fall, 2018 semester, and the Dead Marshes"](#fall-2018-semester-and-the-dead-marshes) and ["Nails"](#nails)).
<!--`I now look like Gollum`, and, though I didn't specify them yet here, there were `other "Gollum-esque" symptoms` as well (see ["Fall, 2018 semester, and the Dead Marshes"](#fall-2018-semester-and-the-dead-marshes) and ["Nails"](#nails)).-->

> [!WARNING]
> By the way, the scariest nightmare I ever had, over and over that whole night, was the day I injected Dupilumab the first time. I remember my housemate at the time in the other room and I wanted to wake him. That's how scared I was. The nightmare was of a tall skinny slenderman, who kept approaching to "assault" me. Every time I closed my eyes and fell asleep, he'd reappear. Again and again, for that whole night. I never had a nightmare like that before. It was vivid.

## Foreboding Electric Razor 

My grandpa gave me his electric razor when I was in high school. It was the first razor I ever had and the only one I'd ever used through high school and college.

In that 2017 summer, before I started the Dupilumab, my mom and I celebrated my graduation from college ("uni," in European-speak) by going to Europe, and my razor broke in the luggage.

<!-- <br><i><b>Note:</b> I finished making this diagram just as Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" started playing on my Spotify, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was "Psycho Killer" which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then "Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar)." Not bad. Any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Sarah to Elliott Smith for the first time with the song "Between the Bars" (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars [Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them]) while we were in the hospital (between the bars of confinement). Since she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there, I think she'll appreciate these observations in this caption when I show her, though it would unfortunately be a non-sequitor to make any claims to their nature or significance. Some of these however are just linguistic.</i> -->

### Uncanny beard premonition

My grandpa actually gave me his razor, an electric razor. It was the first razor I ever had, that I used to shave in high school and all through college. I was right-handed; I'm sure my grandpa used his left hand; I'm sure Charles was startled when I started coming into the office at the Center for Health and Technology, in the late summer of 2017, with the early traces of a beard.

It was the [first time I grew out my beard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144) and I did so out of an intuition, just before Aetna had cut me off from Dupilumab.

## House on May St.

My hair fell out while I lived in my *house on May St.*, a miraculous situation where the landlord—who I'd never met previously—rented me a 4-bedroom nice antique house near both the university and the park in Rochester where the Lilac Festival is held, to myself, for $600/month, starting Fall, 2017—well, technically one bedroom from that house, but I had the whole place to myself pretty much for the next year, and even furnished at least one other bed from another room since, inexplicably and literally miraculously, the landlord didn't believe he could find anyone on his own without my help to rent out to, and he wanted grad students. 

It was beautiful, and even had a porch and balcony, big kitchen, a freezer for big-game hunting (this detail becomes funny later), basement, dishwasher, and laundry machine. Of some of the PhD students who visited me, some needed housing, and later the landlord and I showed them around the rooms (maybe not even prior to me furnishing any of the other bedrooms, which the landlord didn't mind that I'd done, seeing as my best friend and I also beautifully furnished that whole house together during one of my best friend's visits early when I moved in, really beautifully, and that increased the value of the house more, in addition to the sofa and tables and furnishings and beds and desks that the landlord provided—did I mention the word "miraculous" yet?), and one of them even mentioned to the landlord at the end having the funds to pay the full year's rent already—I don't remember why they ended up not moving in, but that was also clearly miraculous. I did end up renting out the attic (which was like a studio apartment, well, a giant room) to one of my friends from high school for the landlord after maybe 4 months of having the place to myself, and even then it was pretty much entirely my house, though he also set up a DJ station for himself in the basement since he threw raves (not in the house), and had his girlfriend over, but he kept quiet, and he wasn't a grad student, but the landlord had a strong belief in my judgement again, miraculously so.

Pets weren't allowed, but that's okay, because there was a [semi-adopted stray who regularly came to visit me outside and sat with me on (or near) my porch named "Batman" (according to his collar)](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/KXoyjpZeM6tsKRrE/), and I loved him very much if the video doesn't make that clear.

Months before I moved out, I became the admin/moderator of the [university Facebook housing page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1112684565415024/) by chance, because the actual admin posted he was looking for a student to moderate the page for him, and I responded that I could do it. My landlord didn't know (and probably still doesn't) that I'm the effective-admin/moderator of that page. Also, since then, I've messaged the manager/admin of that group multiple times to give the moderation to someone else or moderate it himself and he hasn't replied, and doesn't appear to use Facebook, so hereforth I'm permitting myself to call myself the admin. I'm glad to moderate, but not super good at keeping up to date with it. So, after there was no chance left of getting to keep the place to just myself and friend longer, I ended up finding University of Rochester grad students to fill all 4 bedrooms of the house, and all 4 bedrooms of the neighboring house, also belonging to the landlord—I think "semi-detached home" is what it's called—and, thanks to the ad I ended up posting ([here it is](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe5ceff-3b06-4582-97fb-c13c30d00564)), I redirected inquiries to my landlord's email and my landlord's email flooded with other PhD students looking to fill that house, including one of the ones who'd originally wanted and planned to who I'd notified (he moved into the attached one, closer to what was at the time an abandoned building and Highland Park). I ended up adding my landlord to that page, where, technically I'm not supposed to allow landlords, only students. Sorry for this phrasing, but the landlord's house is now "never lacking" in interested grad students looking to rent from him. In fact, lucky for him, the neighboring commercial building is now [a herbal apothecary](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/19/little-apothecary-becomes-little-herbary-south-ave-rochester-ny/2365775001/), since it was abandoned when I lived there (due to, if I recall correctly, a murder, though I didn't know that moving in).

I also grew out a full beard <!--(except a really small patch probably from a lifetime of topical eczema creams, as my pediatrician told me was happening in high school or college)--> and full mustache mostly in those first months I lived in that May St. house, based on an independent Paleo-based intuition/principle. [Here's a picture with my family at that house from my 22nd birthday](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144), not too long after I started to grow it out. My best friend [visited me](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/c7m83bHR5v1mP4p4/) on December 15th, 2017 at that house and encouraged me to shave it (just before we went to a rave that day, the other friend's who would later move in with me, coincidentally), some months before Aetna cut me off from the prescription to Dupilumab, but it was the first time I ever grew out my facial hair.

I was working really hard in that house, developing my long-term memory research ideas and implementing the code for it there, meditating every day while practicing strict dietary (Paleo and organic) disciplines, practicing many asceticisms including not watching movies and TV shows, no unnatural lights after 8 PM except candlelight and always going to bed by 10 or 11, reading philosophy books and academic works for entertainment, cooking all of my food fresh, cold rather than hot showers (e.g., Wim Hof method), while working on campus taking full semesters of grad-level classes, and at the University of Rochester's Medical Center, building neural models to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease, and that house is where I started to get my idea for how stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics could explain a mechanism for "God" or some intelligent power in nature, hypothetically.

I was sleeping in one of the second bedrooms, when, on a rare occasion, my housemate friend and his girlfriend woke me climbing up the stairs. Somehow I had a sudden realization, near around 3 AM or whatever time it was in that night, that the universe's particles might be random, and therefore can be shifted by slight divergences by an intelligence—like the biological kind (or modeled by the artificial kind)—in such a way that still respects the known laws of physics and yet permits the possibility of an intelligent nature, that can modulate how those particles are sampled with respect to the sampling distributions.

In that house, somewhat before, and thereafter (continuing for years, mostly without pause), I was practicing many disciplines, including meditation, Paleo diet, and ascetic disciplines. I learned the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique from an instructor, while living there. The instructor I learned from through the TM program was trained directly by the creator/translator of the technique, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru/yogi the Beatles infamously learned their meditation practice from. I experienced the subtle sinking/melting of my state of consciousness, including visceral physiological sensations, perhaps what some people have observed/called as "Kundalini," that I hadn't heard of yet and came to from Googling my physical sensations, that were a movement in my chest, back of neck/maybe esophagus/throat region, or into my third eye/lobe region, visceral and physical, and that I had full control of the motion of, in each axis direction of movement. The meditation brought my consciousness to a sublime state and alleviated my social anxiety.

<!--
Later, after some time without that "Kundalini" sensation, I described how I theorized TM might work to another skeptical PhD student, my friend Mohsen, who'd actually visited me in that house and met "Batman" once, but on a hiking/camping/kayaking/hotel trip much later in the Adirondacks and Niagra Falls, that it had something to do with the distribution of processing systems in the brain. For example: attenuating to a mantra, reduces other area attention activity such that unconscious thinking processes can be allocated. However, while still in the house on May St., I had a different philosophy, involving my physical body, as well as associative and long-term memory— but I can't remember what it was. I have notes in a small red journal (not a reference to Jung's "Red Book," but I was reading Jung at the time) [here](). To do: find journal and link photos
-->

<!--
The beard had a really small bald patch similar to places on my body where my skin was very smooth that my pediatrician (who I was still seeing in my Freshman year of college) diagnosed while I was a Freshman in college as probably due to the use of prescribed topical creams for eczema on those parts of my body. My chin is one of those areas where I got eczema and had applied those creams through high school and college. My head, eyelashes, armpits, and pubic area weren't.
-->

It was in that house when Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab and my hair started falling out.
<!--
After living in the House on May St., and after my hair had begun falling out, I moved in with my mom to our apartment, where I came up with my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) (the method underlying ChatGPT) in 2018, and it was in the middle of wrapping up that, after all my hair had fallen out, that I was hospitalized (no prior history). It was actually in the first hospitalization, at RGH, where I ran the successful experiments for that paper, since the hospital staff had allowed my mom to bring in my laptop. It was in the second hospital, at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital (see ["The unsampled world at Clover St."](#the-unsampled-world-at-clover-st)), where I described relational reasoning to my brother-in-law and showed that paper to my fellow inpatient, Sarah (real name used with permission).

## Psychiatry at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital

I'm $5\text{'}5\text{'' } 110\text{lb}$.

I had a prescription for benzos before, Xanax, but for eczema and social anxiety, $\text{1/4}$ to $\text{1/2}$ of a milligram to be taken daily or as needed. I took them sometimes during my junior and senior years of college at the University of Rochester, as needed, usually for social anxiety, usually spaced out by more than two weeks, during the time when I took them at all, and they gave me small hangovers/dazes when the effect wore off. Knowing they were in a similar class of drugs to alcohol (see [below](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action)), I took them conservatively.

I had to stay in the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital for a month and take $48\text{x}$ that dosage, of the comparatively strong-per-duration-per-milligram Ativan, reduced later to $10\text{x}$ that dosage, over the course of $3$ times per day, every day, for that month and more than $5$ months after due to doctor-induced dependence and doctor-dependent tapering scheduling, the details of what was being treated still un-inquired about, incommunicable, and unbeknownst to them, solely derived from the medical record from RGH (see ["My trauma"](#my-trauma) for elaboration on this). Think about that. $\text{1/4}$ to $\text{1/2}$ of a milligram, once every two weeks at most (and usually much more rarely), had side effects. $48\text{x}$ $-$ $10\text{x}$ that dosage, but every day.

Accounting for dosage *and* rate, that's a minimum $336\text{x}$ $-$ $70\text{x}$ &nbsp; to &nbsp; $672\text{x}$ $-$ $140\text{x}$ increase.

Just prior to this, the I Ching had answered to me about the reason for the less-than-ideal consciousness that rules humanity: "Difficulty at the beginning" $\rightarrow$ "Increase." My interpretation: Struggle among people from infancy or childhood, or at the outset of a crisis ("Difficulty at the beginning") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) Perpetual acceleration of interventions, or, more specifically, dependence of an individual, collective, or collective standards and systems on more mechanisms of intervention, rather than pause, substitution, remembrance, reconsideration, or decrease of all of what preceded ("Increase"). Yes, all the I Ching answers specified in this book were/are real. The crisis at the "beginning" can also be interpreted as, for example, one's hair no longer sprouting from one's head, or further yet back to simply eczema. <!--Maybe comment out this last sentence-->

For the first three or so weeks, I was really, really drunk/high. Then the fog rolled in. The chemical waterboarding was taking effect.

[This link opens to a video with a different medical philosophy. It's worth clicking on, no matter one's skepticism.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-)

I was also on antipsychotics, but these next chapters will not be about antipsychotics (see ["Geriatric unit hospitalization"](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization) for some elaboration on antipsychotics), since the benzos were added on top of them, making their evaluative efficacy compared to the damage from benzos hard to disentangle. The rest of this Part will be about the experience that was most-plausibly caused by the benzos.

Let's begin a simplified explanation of the brain's neuron. Neurons are cells that are connected to one another by dendrites and axons that pass chemical messengers from one neuron to downstream neurons. The two most common chemical messengers in the brain are the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory means they cause the next neuron to also release their neurotransmitters ("fire"). Inhibitory means they lower the voltage activity of the next neuron such that the next neuron is subdued. GABA is the mechanism of action of alcohol. People think alcohol is "disinhibitory," that it "disinhibits" them, but the reality is alcohol is actually inhibitory. It confuses GABA receptors, causing an inhibition of that neuron and all the neurons in your brain. It's a system-wide drug that indiscriminately simulates GABA throughout every part of your brain, from the Occipital lobe, where your eyes see (in the back of your head), to the frontal lobe, where your brain thinks it thinks.

The brain has evolved some countermeasure thanks <!--at least--> to fermented fruit existing in nature.

Benzos are GABA agonists, like alcohol. That means they simulate GABA or enhance GABA receptor function. In response, the brain downregulates GABA production and receptor sensitivity universally across the brain, universally, from the parts that are understood to the parts that almost entirely aren't, including some of the most important regions of intelligence whose healthy metric level of functioning is extremely hard to measure behaviorally, clinically, and longitudinally across variants of factors, and necessary for quality living, e.g., the hippocampus responsible for long-term memory. Alcohol does this too, but humans have provably evolved natural mechanisms of recovering from small doses of alcohol thanks to fermented fruit existing in nature. Benzos seem like a Godsend, a Panacea, especially since you're less likely to feel a headache the next day from them for the same effect, but the [evidence isn't strong enough to support they're better on the brain in the long-term than alcohol](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/drugs-linked-to-brain-damage-30-years-ago-2127504.html). From what I've gathered, benzos are worse. Since it's somewhat relevant, [here](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) is a video I made on evolutionary algorithms in deep learning.

Nobody understands this mechanism. To understand this mechanism, you'd have to solve all of neurology and artificial intelligence, and psychiatrists definitely haven't. Benzos are a floodbath of GABA, and your brain responds to those GABA bursts by "downregulation," even long, long after cessation.

Despite the similarities to alcohol, benzos are synthetic, achieve much the same effect without a person being able to notice the same short-term consequences like immediate hangover, and are often prescribed to be taken daily for long periods of time. [Studies haven't shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/) that the long-term consequences are preferable to those of alcohol, many [quite the opposite](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8629021/), and <!--(at least)--> my experience<!--, as well as that of [many others](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/), taking only as prescribed, were--> was so severe that I <!--would--> strongly bet worse.

## My Trauma

My trauma revolves around three psychiatrists.

**PSYCHIATRIST 1:** "I will taper you off from the benzos. You will be tapered off *before* discharge."

> `Psychiatrist 1 reassured, I'll be weaned off from the benzos,` *before* `discharge from the hospital.`

**PSYCHIATRIST 2:** "The tapering schedule is too fast (even though we decide when to discharge you) and the outpatient doctor, the psychiatrist after the hospitalization, will taper you off. You will be tapered off *right after* discharge."

> `Psychiatrist 2 came in on the momentum of her previous post (to replace Psychiatrist 1), and changed the schedule, standing next to the first psychiatrist, who hesitantly, self-doubtingly told her that he'd planned to taper me off before the discharge since I was worried.`
>
> `Maybe she didn't trust that I would continue with therapy if the physiological addiction didn't send me there by threat.`
>
> `But she reassured, I'll be weaned off from the benzos,` *right after* `discharge from the hospital.`

**PSYCHIATRIST 3:** "Benzos can be safely taken for years. You need to take them. I want to increase the dose. Did you pull your hair out yourself?"

> `I told Psychiatrist 3 my symptoms. He was cold, authoritative, and disbelieving. He only believed the benzos were needed. He said that benzos could be safely taken for years, and didn't counterargue my points against that that I made to him. At no point for the next 5 months would he specify a tapering schedule, and I was arguing and begging him to taper.`
> 
> `He asked about my hair loss, whether I had pulled the hair out myself. He wouldn't believe me the first couple times I answered. Not only didn't I pull it out myself, but the medical system did, the one that was now making me answer repeatedly whether I did.`
> 
> `I kept begging him to taper in later sessions as well, and he said if I was having all those negative symptoms, that we should increase the dose. That would've started a perpetual race against the brain's downregulation mechanisms.` *He wanted to increase the dose.*

I argued against the benzos with all 3 psychiatrists.

With Psychiatrists 1 and 2, I only took them due to the threat of court order.

With Psychiatrist 3, I only took them due to (a) his recommendation and instruction, (b) the guilt about the earlier hospitalization, and me questioning even the most basic logic and instincts I perceived, while noticeably, adding extremely to the self-doubt, my brain was running slower than others due to the drug, thinking I really was sick in the way these doctors understood, (c) the mental impairment induced by the drug, and (d) insecurity about tapering off by myself, amid the severe physiological dependence.

Furthermore, they were treating a misdiagnosis, "catatonia"—that's what the benzos were prescribed for—that I never went through. I couldn't explain that to them because (a) I didn't know the definition of "catatonia" yet, and (b) the trauma of what I went through was too recent to summarize. 

> `In RGH, they were prescribed due to that false diagnosis of "catatonia." The University of Rochester's Strong Hospital wanted to prevent a recurrence—that is, "preventatively"—threatened a court order if I didn't take them, and 3 psychiatrists changed, contradicted, and perpetually extended each other's scheduling for the taper.`

Additionally, maybe the most unbelievable part: they didn't ask about what I went through. They treated "catatonia" and "bipolar mania" as the indubitably exhaustive description. "Catatonia," which is what the benzos were meant to treat, was fully a misdiagnosis. The other diagnosis from the medical record was "bipolar mania," for which I was being given Risperdals, a strong antipsychotic, in addition to benzos. None of the previous diagnoses from the first hospitalization, none of what RGH wrote, were investigated or asked about in any extent by the University of Rochester's psychiatrists.

Due to their practices, I was on benzos for >6 months. 

Symptoms from taking the benzos as prescribed included: 
- [Severe cognitive impairment](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/)
- [Constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/)
- [Tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/)
- Mouth dryness, and tooth calcification, as diagnosed as being due to benzos by dental hygienist
  - Chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out after the benzos that she diagnosed as decalcification
- Severe generalized anxiety, previously undiagnosed
- [Severe social anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/)
- Inability to sleep due to anxiety
-  [Memory loss, and "greyness" of imaginative and creative ability](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aef90661-f01c-40bc-b8b9-b0a101b80d92)
- [Severe loss of speech and writing quality](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aef90661-f01c-40bc-b8b9-b0a101b80d92)
- [Severe pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dyaf8n/constant_chest_pain_that_spikes_into_my_neck/)
- [Facial structure changed, wrinkled, and my face rapidly lost a healthy appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 
- Severe physiological dependence, which benzos cause more so, at least neurologically, than Dupilumab, which also causes/caused a physiological dependence
- PTSD from all of these symptoms and the recurrence of a malpractice-induced perhaps-permanent trauma
- [Scientifically-backed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/) fear of permanent damage
- [More than a year of all of this, no sleep, non-stop persisting neurochemical torture](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cksl7u/health_disaster_brain_damage_alopecia_universalis/)

Almost nearing Fall, 2019, I tried to kill myself. The helium tank connected to tubing was found by my mom, and my family hid it from me.

A deeper summary of my benzo trauma can be found [here](#flying-colors). <!--[here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/4399be6729f1369e27a3df35eef58fbfe94dcf23/2-Opposing-views.md#my-trauma).-->

The experience of losing my hair has cost me relationships and worsened my social anxiety, and the benzo-brain damage and torture leaves me with PTSD.
